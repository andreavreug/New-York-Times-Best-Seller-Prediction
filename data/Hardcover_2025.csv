Carscaro is a city built on fire, with lava flowing in canals and Mount Fruma behind them. Inside this mountain is where Fýredel has been sleeping for 500 years. Unfortunately, this is the year when Fýredel stirs, putting all of Carscaro in danger. Later in the book, we also follow Aubrecht, the high prince of Mentedon and betrothed to Marosa, as he struggles to discover the fate of his fiancee in the wake of Fýredel's awakening. Finally, rounding out the cast of POVs, we have Melaugo, a culler of sleepers (beasts turned into half wyrms and then put to sleep), who, together with her lover, have to find their way out of a nation under siege.The author bills this as a companion book to Priory of the Orange Tree, and I agree with that. While this can be read on its own, I think if you want any sort of closure or continuance on events, you need to read Priory of the Orange Tree to get it. But I do think this highlights the fact that not only can the author write giant 1000+ page epics, she can also write shorter bites of her world's larger history for fans too.I loved Marosa's viewpoint best of the ones presented here. She carries herself well in the face of everything crumbling around her, and the ending (such as it is, presented here) had me feeling all sorts of things for her. If you've already read Priory of the Orange Tree you already have an idea of what's to come here, but it still manages to catch me by surprise. Aubrecht's viewpoint, too, really hit me in the feels, as he struggles to figure out what to do personally and publicly after Fýredel awakens. The third viewpoint, Melaugo, was interesting, but felt a bit removed from the other two. The author uses her as a window into how events impact the common folk of Yscalin, but it never actually intersects at all with either Marosa or Aubrecht at this point so it just felt a little tacked on.There is a romance here, because it is Samantha Shannon, but the romance is already established before the book starts, so there's no development or anything beyond some ex- drama that needs resolving.I did absolutely enjoy this book though, and look forward to more ""short"" stories in this Roots of Chaos series she's squeezing in amongst her main books.

When books are this short I expect every page to pack a punch and for it to have a defined goal. This did neither of those things. Rather, it was like a full-length novel packed into a quarter of the pages, with a quarter of the impact. It’s still worth the read if you loved Priory because it adds some context to what’s going on at that time, but is definitely the weakest of the bunch.",Among the Burning Flowers,2025-01-09T14:41:53.515668,"With the awakening of fire-breathing dragons, Among the Burning Flowers sees the first sparks of danger that threaten to consume the world in The Priory of the Orange Tree.

1684749,2026-01-27T19:56:35.460895+00:00,"I received this book as ARC from Netgalley. I didn't read the others two books of this series when I read this one and I don't regret doing it like this. I actually owned the others two books as paperback for a few months now but was always put off by the size of them. You definitely need time and energy to go through it if Among the burning flowers is any proof of this. The book is around 200 pages so way less than the others two. And in my opinion, a good way to start with this series, to be sure you are in a mood for it before reading the massive books in the series then. It's detailed, descriptive, heavy in politics and world building. A map could be great but as I read an Arc version it's not the definitive vision. Hopefully it will be added in the final version. Great characters development and diversity. I liked most of the main female characters and how they are built. Lot of depth and substance.I'll definitely read the other two massive books because this story is awesome. It's rich and well written. Its poetic and darkly beautiful. The feeling are well exposed and the world building seems to be massive if I based my impression on this shorter book. If you like a good high fantasy with lot of politics, mythical creatures, knights and monster hunters, princesses (though those ones are pretty badass and not the patriarchal and sexist traditional kind) who own their shit and great plots, then go for it. I totally recommend this book and I'll go for the test of the series myself soon with pleasure.",Among the Burning Flowers,2025-01-09T14:41:53.515668,"With the awakening of fire-breathing dragons, Among the Burning Flowers sees the first sparks of danger that threaten to consume the world in The Priory of the Orange Tree.

But when that keeps happening over and over again, you're just dealing with a main character who is very dumb. I hate read this book because I wanted to know which direction the author takes it. And I was pretty surprised by it, and not gonna lie — I did like that direction. Except it happens in the very end. None of the characters are fully fleshed out and I get it. The ending hinted at a sequel so you're aiming for character arcs. But I need to know SOMETHING about the characters. It's not that difficult to make the readers familiar with your characters and their motivations in the first book. Antonia hodgson did it. Rachel gilig did it. So many authors have done it. All I know about Holland is that she's incredibly stupid with no survival instincts, loves myths and legends, and wants to uncover what happened to her parents. THAT'S IT. And I don't know ANYTHING ELSE about January, Gabe, Adam or Mason. And they're all hinted at being such important characters too.

1727792,2025-12-30T02:24:39.739825+00:00,"Alchemy of Secrets is Stephanie Garber’s debut Adult novel which follows Holland as she races against the ticking clock to save her own life. 
“But the problem with feelings is sometimes you don’t get to choose them.”Obviously, by my rating, I really enjoyed this book. However, I can see why people do not. I’m going to try to be fair in my overall review of this book, because I actually think this is a really complicated one. 
Let’s start with the obvious: the reads exactly like every other Garber book. While this is a positive for me, I can see why someone would be disappointed by this. Holland very well could have even a few years younger and this would have been a YA book. That being said, I’m really not all that stressed about if a book is YA, NA, or Adult, so that really played no part in my rating.Due to this reading like all of her other books (although set in present-day LA), this book reads like a fairytale. Sure, there are buildings and traffic and iconic stars mentioned, but honestly, I hardly clocked most of it. If you told me this took place in the same universe as Caraval, I’d believe it. There is this sense of found magic and dark whimsy that lives in all of Garber’s books, and this one is no exception.I’ll be honest in that I realize there was something plot holes in this book (which I’ll get to) and maybe the mystery cannot be solved on your own (I can’t say as I was really just along for the ride on this one - the mystery might be the main plot but it’s not what I was interested in), but I thought this was fun. The twists were somewhat predictable, but a few of them took me by surprise, and some of them I’m still not sure what to think. This book really tries to make it impossible to know who to trust, which is what I was mostly focused on as I’m still not sure. I have seen some criticism that many people don’t believe they’d take time to indulge in stories and act as Holland did if they knew they may die soon, but honestly, to me, it always seemed like she was working toward an answer. She did better than I would have (aka cry and give up).So here are my actual criticisms:1. The word “Miscellanea” was used often enough that I noticed it being used. I read this a mix of audio and physical, so I can’t search the book for how many times, but it felt like too many. Saying there was “clutter” or “other items” would have gotten the point across. I don’t know why this bothered me so much, but it did.2. At one point Holland understands she is going into a dangerous situation and she puts on heels. I know girlie has her head in the clouds, but this was a wild and ultimately unimportant decision (okay, I know why she does it from a story telling perspective, BUT this was already done/shown in a dozen different ways, so it wasn’t necessary).3. I didn’t love the 2nd POV inserts. I understand they’re there to kind of set the mood, but they didn’t do it for me. I think 2nd POV can be good, but it’s really hard to make it work, and here I think it would have been just as compelling to write it in third or first person instead, and less jarring.4. January and their mother (I’ll explain more below)(spoilers beyond this point, unfortunately):
.
.
.
.
.
Let’s pick up where I left off. This was my biggest issue with the book if I’m honest. Holland tells us she loves her sister and appreciates her, and I know she’s outrunning death, but she doesn’t try all that hard to get in contact with her. I can believe she doesn’t know her number (I also don’t know my sister’s number off the top of my head) but January has no other means of communication? Email? Social media? Anything??? If I knew I was dying and I started uncovering all of these secrets about my sister and our family, I would not stop until I got in touch with her. If I was Holland, I would be thinking my sister is dead, especially since there is a small (very unlikely but still present) chance that she worked with or had contact with Adam. At the least, Adam knows about her. It wouldn’t be crazy if he killed her. Which is also why I have to ask, Holland, girl, why do you just trust anyone your sister “sent” without actual confirmation??? Like both people you trusted claimed were sent by your sister (who potentially lied to you and kept secrets), so what’s up with trusting and then not trusting both of them? Girl.I also find it a little annoying her mother is so ignored. I get Holland loved her father (how old was she when he died? It felt unclear) and I get that her mother has this awful (maybe false, maybe not) reputation, but it felt like the book wanted us to forget she existed. This may have been intentional for something in book two, but I didn’t love all the love her father got and how little thought her mother received.I also have some questions that I think are intentionally left unanswered for the next book (so really, this is just a reminder for future self):1. What is up with Chance? He obviously knows something is up, and we got the information about no one remembering Adam, but that never really amounted to anything. I have to assume it will come back up later since at that point we already knew Adam’s power2. I have a theory that Adam and the Watch Man are working together. I’m actually willing to bet the Watch Man doesn’t really know when people are going to die, but gives out sentences to those that Adam wants something from. From there they live is Adam gets what he wants and don’t if he doesn’t. I might be wrong on this, but it just kind of makes sense (especially because Jake died at his hands and Holland technically did a million times)3. Another theory I have is that Holland’s ability will be to see diverging timelines, kind of like seeing into the future, but more direct and closer to the present. She basically already does this, so it makes sense.4. I need to know the situation with Gabe. Obviously he isn’t to be more grey leaning than evil. On one hand, he did leave her with Adam and wanted the  Alchemical Heart for himself (for a book 2 reason presumably), but I actually don’t think he’s evil. I might slot him into the Legend or Jacks category, honestly.5. Did January actually send anyone? My theory is she did actually meet Adam and he did that brain washing thing since the last time she spoke with Holland she didn’t sound like herself. I’m curious if maybe Gabe knows Adam did that to her but can’t say for ~reasons~ and that’s his motivation? Not sure.",Alchemy of Secrets,2025-01-30T04:53:46.159189,"It starts with a class in an old movie theater.

I truly think that we don't know enough about him and his true intentions for me to decide whether I like or dislike him. However, with the information we have, I will say that I do like him. I'm not, like, in love with him or whatever, but I think he's a good character, even if he did want to find the Alchemical Heart. I feel like his and Holland's story is so unfinished, though. Obviously in the epilogue, she said (in her monologue) “She knew there wasn't a version where she could have walked out of the Hollywood Roosevelt with Adam, but she did wonder if there might have been a version where she left with Gabe”, which just makes me wonder.Like I said though, we don't know enough about him or his intentions with Holland or the Alchemical Heart for me to make a full statement on him.MASON: I know we know so little about him, but I actually do think that he is the real love interest. There was this quote that said “She just knew it scared her a little”, talking about Mason, and obviously the person she loves “scaring her a little” was a thing that was brought up quite a few times in this book, and it just makes me think that maybe he is the true love interest. He also left his card for her, so I think there will be a time where they interact again.Also, in a way, he reminds me of Jacks (maybe just ‘cause he's blonde and hot), which also adds to the factor that he's maybe the love interest.THE PROFESSOR AND JANUARY: I don't know how I feel about them. They're portrayed as characters that have more ambiguity than others (like Adam (for evil) and Holland (for good)). So, I can't really say anything about them, but I'm hoping to find out more in the second one (YES THERE'S A SECOND ONE!!)OVERALL I'm so glad that Stephanie Garber is giving us a second book. There is so much left unsaid at the end of this book; what's truly happened to Adam; where January is; who did January send, Adam or Gabe?; where is Gabe?; why will Holland need to cash in her debt with Mason? JUST TOO MANY QUESTIONS.However, I'm also open to the side that this could be more of an ambiguous ending. Where the reader doesn't really know what happens to them, but they can open it to speculation.   I thought that this book was the best written of Stephanie's. I love the small chapters in second person (“you”). This was also one of the most confusing books I've probably ever read, which I actually think is a mark of a good book. The writer wants you to feel confused because Holland is confused, almost. Obviously this isn't the same for all books, but I think it is for this one.Because of all these factors, I think I'll give this book a 4.5 star. There's still so much ambiguity about what is going to happen, who the love interest is—Gabe or Mason—and I think my mind will be stuck on this for a while because I just enjoyed it so much. There was a point in this book where I thought I was gonna give it 4.75, but that changed, unfortunately, but 4.5 is still a pretty high ranking, and I'm glad because I feel like the majority of my reads the last few months haven't been the best. I also think that this is my second favourite new release this year, after Not Quite Dead Yet. Although, that isn't necessarily difficult because all new releases this year have been misses for me, unfortunately.PRE-RELEASEOML WHAT?A NEW STEPHANIE GARBER BOOK TOO?

Folklore 517: Local Legends and Urban Myths, taught by a woman called the Professor.

Most students believe the Professor’s stories are just fiction. There isn’t a man in Hollywood who you can call to find out the time you’ll die. There’s not a haunted hotel bar in Los Angeles that the devil likes to frequent. There’s no such thing as magic.

But . . . most students don’t have the same tragic past as Holland St. James.

Now a graduate student, Holland is hoping to use her thesis to rewrite her past by proving that some of the most infamous deaths in old Hollywood were actually murders committed by the devil. She has no idea that this quest will lead her into a deadly world of century-old secrets and unimaginable lies and onto the path of two very dangerous men, both of whom are willing to do whatever it takes to find a magic that will either forever alter Holland’s life or completely destroy it.",Stephanie Garber

I'm excited to see the tv adaptation of this book when it comes out- The main character Holland is not bad but she is kinda boy crazy like every single man who comes into her life she will immediately trust and get feelings for. I'm not even kidding the girl has 4 love interests.- There are so many loose ends things are just brought up and then abandoned, I personally am a fan of closed loops so this was a bit frustrating for me. Questions I have: Why did the necklace form into the alchemical heart symbol? Did Gabe kill his wife? Who is January's boyfriend? What did Adam say to Vic Vanfleet? What happened on the last night of Chance's wrap party for his tv show? Who is Mason referring to when he says ""We think they’re a side effect of the time loop?"", What do the matching tattoos mean/why does everyone have them?, Why does Adam kill Holland at the end? Why is Sword and Cross brought up so much throughout the book (I'm dead serious, is this something that will come back or is it a metaphor??), What was the deal Holland's parents made?- Very convoluted lore, but that's pretty much all of Garber's work so- Love Cat and Elaine and I didn't mind Chance either- I listened to this via audiobook because I tend to skim over descriptive writing when I'm physically reading and I gotta say Sutton Foster the narrator of this book killed it, most professional Hollywood actors who dabble in reading audiobooks usually do because they don't put on voices they just convey emotions and demeanour and so it never feels cringey or forced- I did not like Gabe very much especially at the start, he was just rude and annoying and his name SUCKS. Gabe is the name of a toddler- Adam served his purpose but he was too oily for my taste ykwim, plus him hitting on other girls (dancing with that woman at the black and white club, and saying Isabella from Sword and Cross is hot gave me the ick). - Holland is such an idiot for trusting Adam, think with your head girl. He said he was ""Sent to protect her by January"" but the entire time he literally did nothing to actually protect her. How is lying to her and saying your her new professor going to protect her? How is ransacking her mentor's house behind her back all while she's being allegedly chased by a murderer going to protect her. Holland's kind of an idiot.- But at the same time I really resent January for keeping everything from Holland I feel like she really infantilised her by doing that, like y'all are the same age. She's a grown woman, she'll be fine...If we do get January's pov I want a good explanation not this I was protecting you from the truth bullshit- I am without a doubt, 100% TEAM MASON. If he does something shitty in the next book I don't claim that but for now 100% rooting for him. The subtle angst, saying Adam is a temu version of his brother in retrospect. GAGGED. I lived for his scenes with Holland- I liked how accurate all the fake history and movie names were, it made the world feel more real- I have a very strong feeling the ability Holland will get in the next book will be the ability to detect lies. The entire book she is lead astray by so many people's lies and deceptions, AND we see this ability highlighted by the clerk at The Regal and in her father's bloodline. If she had this ability it would resolve a big character flaw- Another theory I have is that whoever January's ""boyfriend"" is, is trying to steal her ability. We find out from the bank's anecdote about Gabe that he married his wife then the next day she died and he inherited her ability. If someone was merely trying to manipulate January a love spell would of sufficed, why get engaged?- The twist about the old man sitting on the table at the end was such a weird visual and kinda grossed me out. Idk why but it made me picture the ski equipment guy from FrozenOverall so far not as great as Stephanie Garber's other series but still good because of her great writing style.

I think the reason Careless People is getting so many glowing five-star reviews is mostly because people love seeing someone stick it to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg right now. And I totally get the appeal of criticizing big tech, but if you judge the book just on its merits, it definitely doesn't deserve this much praise.Wynn-Williams is not a bad writer, especially considering it's her first book, and there are a few interesting or amusing anecdotes. But from the very first chapter, her tone is so exaggerated, it's hard to take seriously. She constantly presents herself as smarter, more ethical, and generally superior to everyone around her, including suggesting that Zuckerberg wouldn't even have had access to some influential people without her help. It's so exaggerated it quickly becomes annoying.The book feels driven by bitterness, and the author often seems more interested in settling personal scores than offering meaningful insights or analysis. Almost every page comes across as a way for Wynn-Williams to highlight how everyone else around her is either incompetent, unethical, or just plain stupid. It completely undermines the credibility of her story and weakens any genuine critique she might have.Additionally, the book suffers from a lack of focus. Many chapters feel random, filled with irrelevant anecdotes that go nowhere—like her long section about struggling to find a manual breast pump in Turkey or being worried about getting Zika. It's not deep enough to be a biography, so not sure what role those stories play. If you still want to read it, I'd suggest approaching it as casual entertainment rather than expecting deep insights into big tech. Wynn-Williams certainly has potential as a writer, but this book would have benefited greatly from being shorter, sharper, and far less self-centered.",Careless People,2025-04-08T22:40:10.394684,"From trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold.

Nothing surprised me, except one attention-getting anecdote about Sheryl Sandberg that seems too childish to be real.What stuck with me the most is how important it is to do the inner work to deal with your own demons. To learn how to value yourself, stand up from yourself, and say no.I understand the dynamics in these places and that things slowly get worse, but I’m still amazed how much the author tolerated. She was young, and I tolerated way too much shit in my 20’s too, but I still can’t fathom flying across the world while still dealing with massive blood loss and near death after having a baby. I also can’t imagine demanding that of an employee in the first place. The failures of “leadership” all the time, on every level, is mine-boggling.This woman has had TWO near death experiences, and that’s not including the scary situations she was in while representing Facebook.She opens with a horrific story from her childhood that kind of explains why she perseveres when she shouldn’t,  and I found that part heartbreaking. I hope she’s been able to heal from all that now.In terms of the dirt about Sandberg, I have never trusted what I’ve heard about her and am proud to have never read Lean In. There were signs. She’s like the female version of Elon Musk: somehow had great PR and no one listened to all the people dropping hints until the stories hit some sort of tipping point. You don’t align yourself with and clean up the messes of the world’s sleaziest company and somehow have — or retain — any integrity.The fact that the author so deeply believed in Facebook and is single-handedly responsible for getting Zuck to care about (and be involved in) politics… is wild. At the end, she realizes it backfired, but wow. That throughline, of her seeing the coming regulation and potential and need for someone to steward it was insightful, but at the end of the day Facebook simply does not care about the harm they cause, blatantly lie about everything, and collaborate with dictators if it pads the bottom line.

Sarah does an excellent job being honest about the horrid behavior of Meta's executives without the book feeling like a screed or an act of vengeance. Simply put, these were powerful people who misused their influence, either through active malice or (more often, as the title suggests) carelessness. The author opens the book by narrating a powerful experience from her childhood. She uses it to explain the origins of her idealistic worldview. She's consistently self-critical, and investigates her complicity in Facebook/Meta's actions, as well as the strain she placed on her family by giving everything to the company. Her psychoanalysis of Sheryl, Mark, and other Facebook leaders never feels overwrought. She draws conclusions about these people based on her actual experience. She is responsible, and doesn't extend her analysis into the realm of speculation (and she easily could have - it would have been fun for the reader). I'm not a journalist, but a great deal of her observations on Facebook's inner workings are substantiated by publicly-available information. And her allegations that Facebook was essentially building spyware for the CCP are rightfully being investigated by Congress.Sarah was courageous in publishing this book and I'm glad she did. It's a whistleblower's account, but it's also just a good book.

Almost getting kidnapped while pregnant, volunteering to be ""the body"" to test if facebook workers would get arrested in other countries while having that new baby at home, ALMOST DYING during the 2nd pregnancy and LUCKY to be alive and deciding not to give a damn OPENLY about doctor's advice, husband, and risking your life while you ALREADY HAVE two children so you could have a third?! WTF are you doing Sarah???  Careless.  I'm convinced that Sarah's book is just better marketed than the previous whistleblower book AND has a bit of a streisand effect going for it.  I'm all about the dish on facebook though - so if you liked this you may like The Power of One: Blowing the Whistle on Facebook By Frances Haugen.  (2023).  I was so tired of Sarah's nonsense - a disaster girl.  One part i'm like, stop you're in a cult and the other part I felt like i was listening in on some juicy gossip.  None of this is new about facebook, i've been curbing my usage before I just decided to delete it (in 2025 - 20 year user RIP) So, i knew exactly about a lot of the functions and discussion about it back in the day.

But once I got past that, the book really took off. It definitely changed the way I view Facebook. While I’ve always suspected that Facebook was doing shady things with the data it collects, suspecting it and actually reading about the specifics are two very different experiences.A common criticism of the author is that she portrays herself as a good person who didn’t do anything wrong. But since this is her memoir, that seems understandable.

I’m already quite cynical about Big Tech, and I thought that this would only entrench my biases further, with no real benefit to my mental health. But I saw it sitting on the shelf at my library and I just couldn’t help myself.The author, Sarah Wynn-Williams, worked at Facebook in the global policy department, where her responsibility was (ostensibly) to help the company negotiate with countries around the world. She started with the optimism typical of tech companies in the early aughts, believing that she would “make the world a better place.” But over the course of the book, she becomes disillusioned by Facebook’s relentless pursuit of growth and profit, which came at the high cost of creating political instability in countries like Myanmar and ultimately the US.None of this is very surprising, if you follow the news about social media companies over the last few years. But Wynn-Williams’ position gave her access to the top brass at Facebook, Cheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, and she reveals some really bizarre behaviour by the leaders of the company. For example, Zuckerberg once asked her, on a visit to Indonesia, to organize a “gentle mob,” for no apparent reason other than to make himself look cool. These sections were both hard to read and hard to put down, having the feeling of learning some juicy gossip about someone you don’t like. You kind of have to take her word for it, because corroboration from other sources is not really built into the narrative style, but if it’s true, these incidents confirm the old adage that power corrupts.",Careless People,2025-04-08T22:40:10.394684,"From trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold.

To trace the history of the twenty-first century so far is to trace a history of unaffordability and shortage. After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, America has a national housing crisis. After years of limiting immigration, we don’t have enough workers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven’t built anything close to the clean-energy infrastructure we need. Ambitious public projects are finished late and over budget—if they are ever finished at all. The crisis that’s clicking into focus now has been building for decades—because we haven’t been building enough.

Abundance explains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear’s villains. Rather, one generation’s solutions have become the next gener­ation’s problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the problems of the 1970s often prevent urban-density and green-energy projects that would help solve the problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished.

Progress requires facing up to the institutions in life that are not working as they need to. It means, for liberals, recognizing when the government is failing. It means, for conservatives, recognizing when the government is needed.

Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished.

Progress requires facing up to the institutions in life that are not working as they need to. It means, for liberals, recognizing when the government is failing. It means, for conservatives, recognizing when the government is needed.

1765480,2025-11-08T08:27:49.83324+00:00,"Abundance provides a useful framing for the recurring challenges the United States has faced in sustaining growth over the past century. Klein highlights compelling examples of both success and failure, but misses the mark in analyzing and extracting lessons from them. The book ultimately offers no clear narrative beyond calls for stronger centralization and further deregulation of the state.Even in its examples, Klein writes with a kind of incredulity toward public coordination. He admonishes the beaurocratic burdens placed on a builder, while immediately stating costs were completely offset through grants or tax breaks.  He claims “[Public Housing projects] have a bad reputation in the United States, but beautiful developments have opened in places like Montgomery County, Maryland.. [but they are] not possible under the rules and strictures that liberals have designed within the governments they run”.   He portrays the NIH as insufficiently effective even while every dollar invested generates more than 250% in economic activity.While the book correctly identifies the importance of building efficiently, it downplays the equally vital question of who benefits, who bears the costs, and how power is distributed when large projects are undertaken. By treating regulation as merely a barrier rather than a safeguard for marginalized communities, Abundance confuses procedural dysfunction with democratic accountability. That blind spot explains much of the (deserved) pushback to the book's “abundance agenda” — a vision that mistakes technocratic speed for justice and equates state capacity with centralization rather than empowerment.",Abundance,2025-02-13T10:24:02.830843,"From bestselling authors and journalistic titans Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, Abundance is a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to renew a politics of plenty, face up to the failures of liberal governance, and abandon the chosen scarcities that have deformed American life.

I listened to this as an audiobook and I can only assume that chapters 1-3 were narrated by one person and the rest of the book was narrated by the other author. The book became much easier to listen to at chapter 4.Chapters 4 and on were much better. I found the argument there much clearer, concise, and backed up with more effective examples. Overall I was disappointed by this read. I guess I was expecting something with actual possible solutions other than “deregulate and remove red tape” when a bunch of problems we have in today's economy were the result of deregulation and allowing corporations large amounts and power and funds to lobby.",Abundance,2025-02-13T10:24:02.830843,"From bestselling authors and journalistic titans Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, Abundance is a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to renew a politics of plenty, face up to the failures of liberal governance, and abandon the chosen scarcities that have deformed American life.

Little in it is explicitly objectionable (which is a major part of what makes reading it so frustrating), but as soon as you start fact checking its narrative, everything falls apart. Unfortunately, this means that readers who read it uncritically are likely to support the agenda, which is functionally indistinguishable from what the national Democrats have been doing for decades. And in case you're under the impression that it includes any policy proposals, it does not. The least vague one is that Democratic electeds just need to magically have more will, brush off various progressive interest groups, and just do the things they promise to do. Oh and in their utopian vision of the abundant future the profits from the AI bubble will somehow be shared with the people for widespread prosperity.

I dreamt of migrating there and becoming a hot-shot IT guy in Silicon Valley.My belief was further fuelled by people like Noam Chomsky, Barack and Michelle Obama, Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt, Robert Langer, and, last but not least, Kamala Harris.I feverishly followed those 107 days of Harris’ campaign and loved how she presented her vision for the USA, the world, and herself. Her authentic passion and the joy she exuded gave me hope.Then the USA elected, for the second time, the racist felon whose Republican administration is now responsible for the death of millions of people around the globe. The current US administration is dismantling everything good about the USA and leaving it as many from my generation have always seen the USA: an imperialist nation that forces other countries into compliance.Now, my only hope is that the sheer incompetence of said administration will be their downfall: an intellectually challenged president, an oafish backwater turd as VP, a “war” secretary running the Pentagon like a frat house on steroids - a drunken, misogynistic circus where the bar tab is as scandalous as the supposedly secure documents, a self-styled medical maverick who treats science like folklore, spreading conspiracy memes, apologising by text, and claiming no memory of infamy, a blonde right-wing barbie spinning inflated stats, and picking civil rights when they’re convenient - just ignoring the rest of the US Constitution, and a mercurial voice claiming civil liberties, parroting disinformation, shifting ideologies, and cherry-picking minority rights when it fits her brand.All the more so since Kamala Harris had wonderful ideas and plans. Had she even been able to implement a fragment of what she describes in “107 Days”, ironically, it would have actually made the US great again.Harris writes engagingly in short- to medium-length chapters about every step along the way. We don’t learn anything really new, but it’s still highly interesting to get to know Harris’ personal points of view and how she actually felt. More often than not, I was in tears when comparing her ideals, her plans, and what she did with what is happening right now.I agree with almost everything she writes but one major point she’s trying to make: Harris writes that two thirds of the US population did not vote for Trump. She’s being honest in stating that one third simply stayed home instead of voting. This is not a valid excuse, though: the US citizens knew what was at stake - namely their democracy - and they still didn’t vote.This is why Harris is wrong: You The People are responsible for Trump. You The People are complicit in what your administration is committing. You The People do not rise against the current administration in defence of your democracy.Instead, you let your modern Gestapo, ICE, randomly arrest people who are not white enough or speak with an accent. Your corrupted Supreme Court is the new Volksgerichtshof the majority of judges of which give all of this their blessings.What we see in the news daily, this is who you are now, and I promise you: We, The World, may eventually forgive but we will never forget.Five stars out of five.Ceterum censeo Putin esse delendam",107 Days,2025-08-06T19:34:51.273298,"For the first time, and with surprising and revealing insights, Kamala Harris tells the story of one of the wildest and most consequential presidential campaigns in American history.

Harris and Walz would've been an amazing duo on Capitol Hill. It is the American people who either didn't vote for Harris and those who chose to stay at home who are to blame for the shit-show we are in now. I absolutely love that Kamala Harris wrote this book, it was exactly what I and I'm sure many others who feel lost, needed. This book is a reality check. Yes cruelty prevailed but the fight isn't over.

📢 Narrated by Kamala Harris
⏱ Duration: 10 hours
🏷️ Genre: Non-FictionThis one feels like being handed a backstage pass to the Harris–Trump showdown and then realizing the stage hands are quietly on fire in the wings. The day‑by‑day structure keeps things moving, and you can almost hear the clock ticking down on those 107 days, which makes the inevitability of how it all ends sting a little more. Listening to Harris narrate her own story adds an extra layer of intimacy; the calm, measured tone softens some of the sharper political edges, even when she’s clearly furious at how the machine failed her.What really stands out is how clearly the book reflects on how things unraveled. With the benefit of hindsight, and given how things are unfolding now, the narrative lands differently. You start connecting dots, noticing missed moments, and quietly thinking, if only. That said, this is still a political memoir, and it reads like one. There’s transparency, yes, but also framing, positioning, and careful storytelling. I found myself appreciating the insight while also mentally bookmarking sections to take with a grain of salt.The book doesn’t fix anything about where the U.S. is now; it just makes the whole mess feel both more understandable and more depressing, like watching the slow‑motion replay of a game you already know your team lost. Still, if you’ve ever wondered what it actually felt like inside that campaign, this gives you enough texture and detail to make you sit back and think, “So that’s how we got here.”Would I recommend it?
Solid listen if you're into political memoirs or still processing the 2024 election fallout, Kamala's narration adds that personal punch that makes the revelations land deeper. It's thought-provoking, a bit bittersweet, and definitely sparks those ""what could have been"" thoughts. Worth it for the unique vantage point on modern American democracy.If Only We Knew Then: What Stands Out Most?

Historical literary fiction following Tom, a young English man, who works as a shanker (fisherman), but dreams of becoming a folk singer; one day he encounters Edgar, a film director from Hollywood who hires him to show him potential locations for his next movie.This was such a lovely little read. 
The writing was lush and evocative, the author did such a great job recreating the bleak seaside location, the hard and monotonous life of a fisherman. The setting made me remember of how a town on the Belgian coast is keeping this tradition (of shrimp fishing with horses) alive today. 
The atmosphere was perfectly damp like the moody sea weather, I loved the descriptions of the ghostly, claustrophobic and threatening presence of the fog on the beach. So this was a perfectly appropriate book for this wintery season. 
I really liked the slow burn character centric approach, that allows us to get into Tom’s thoughts, his aspirations and hopes, his desperation for another life. There was an emotional intelligence and positivity to Tom that made this a compelling and enriching read. 
I liked how the author discussed various themes on art, motherhood, tradition, family, choice, happiness, working class, ambition, etc
The pacing itself was good though the ending and the characters’ arc resolutions felt a bit too abrupt, and I would have liked more fleshed out scenes with side characters.

On the other side, Margaret Salt's early life in an orphanage, and her questions about her birth mother leading to her eventual independence. Felix Salt's harrowing experiences serving in the Navy during the war profoundly alter his life, adding another layer of complexity to the family saga.A pivotal event during the war inextricably links these two families, setting in motion a series of revelations that will only fully unfold for most of them many years later.

Somebody’s parents are dead, somebody’s kid is dead, some people keep dying.The main character is an unreliable asshole except the author doesn’t seem to realize it, even as he repeatedly makes bad selfish choices. It’s uninteresting. It is a feel good story that never earns the good feeling. It is a Thomas Kinkade painting etched onto a postage stamp. It does nothing to challenge the reader, or inspire.

PJ and his family have seen some tragedy in their lives (pay very close attention to trigger warnings for this book, because hoo boy is there a lot to process). He's surprised to become a sudden guardian to a young brother-and-sister pair (Ollie and Luna) who have lost their parents under tragic circumstances. Along with PJ's adult daughter Sophie (and Pancakes the cat), the group goes on a cross-country road trip to find PJ's lost love, with some interesting detours along the way. There's a lot going on here so pay close attention or you'll miss something. I read a lot of romance,  which I adore. But the thing is, those stories can be predictable. This story was not predictable in any way, and it was an adventure to follow along with PJ and Pancakes (which, incidentally, would be a great title for a buddy-cop dramedy). The subplot with Pancakes' special talent was an amusing diversion from the darker themes, even though Pancakes' purpose in the story was inherently dark. Overall the book was a little hard for me to get into, there was a grimness to the story that kept popping up in ways that were surprising to me. I struggled to finish but the mood did lighten here and there throughout the book (helped along a great deal by the dry wit used by the author). But despite the pervasive wit, this is a gloomy book wearing a thin veneer of hope and love.PJ was very hard for me to warm up to, he had a selfish streak that defined almost everything he did and all of his relationships. This was definitely a theme for the book: very few of the characters were 100% lovable which, of course, is realistic. It also kept me on edge as I was reading though, wondering what troubling character trait was going to pop up next in which person. And I guess the over-arching theme here is that no one is happy and we're all damaged and just doing the best we can. And of course that death, like love, is unavoidable.I was probably not the right audience for this story. But even though I struggled a bit to finish and I found the story to be darker than expected, I'm giving this 4 stars for the quality of the writing, the author's attention to detail, and the increasingly ridiculous storyline with all of its quirks. And, of course, for Pancakes. :) Publishes April 29, 2025.

She tells me we are taking the minibus to Fairhaven tomorrow morning, and it’s also been a while since we’ve done that. What are we to do there? Information has yet to be forthcoming. “A nice stroll along the front” is what Elizabeth said, and if you believe that you’ll believe anything.What’s The Impossible Fortune About?Joyce’s daughter, Joanna, is getting married. During the reception, Elizabeth is approached by someone wanting help. He’s heard about Elizabeth from Joanna and would rather go to her for help than anyone else.Then he goes missing. The Club mobilizes to try to find him—with some help from Joyce’s daughter and new son-in-law, too.Ron’s a little distracted by some family trouble (trouble he doesn’t realize the depth of, either), but that won’t be enough to derail the Thursday Murder Club, will it?Elizabeth“Screenshot the messages,” says Joanna. “We have to find Nick.”“Screenshotting them,” says Paul. “I’ll send them straight to the police.”Joanna puts her hand on his.“Honestly? God bless the police, but it’ll be quicker all round if we just show them to Elizabeth.”The core of this book is Elizabeth moving on from full-time grieving. She’ll be grieving for the rest of her (hopefully long and sequel-filled) life. But equipped with a puzzle—and potential danger to others—some of her old spark comes back.Something noted by the rest of the Club—and Donna, too.This doesn’t mean she’s as sharp as we’re used to—she notes that herself. By the end of the book, that’s done with. Still, even an out-of-practice Elizabeth is better than the police assigned to this case (sadly, not our friends—nor are they likely to be seen again).We are treated to seeing her alone—or almost alone sometimes—and vulnerable. It’s Elizabeth at her most human, which is wonderful to see (even if we all probably prefer Elizabeth the super-hero).Joyce and JoannaThe relationship between Joyce and her daughter has been a frequent topic to return to, and change has been slow—if not imperceptible. But we get some strong movement here—and some frustrating delays in it, too (designed to be frustrating, this isn’t Osman flubbing things).Overall, we see the two of them working together here—on the wedding and on the case. It warms the heart to see. They both make some healthy compromises—and conspire together in way that’ll make you smile.So, what did I think about The Impossible Fortune?Danny Lloyd has had guns pointed at him before, but never by a woman. It makes, he notes to himself now, very little difference. The gun is the thing. Well, the bullets inside the gun are the actual thing, aren't they?Keep the bullets inside the gun, that’s the trick.Frankly, it feels like Osman was a little off his game with this one. And it makes sense—after the big events of The Last Devil to Die, almost everything is going to feel like a letdown. He also needs to re-establish the feel for the books now.We’ve added a new character or two, made some pretty big changes for some (at least one of which is going to stick with the books for a while). Just the sheer amount of time we spend with Johanna and Ron’s son, Ritchie, makes this feel different. I don’t want to get into the Ron-and-his-family storyline, but man, it’s good.My biggest concern is Ibrahim’s depiction. He didn’t get that much space—which makes sense; there’s a lot of competition this time. But in most of the space he was given, he seemed…off. He felt sillier and dafter than usual, almost like the novel was gently mocking him. But that eventually went away, and he really came through for the team more than once in pivotal ways. Also—he’s great, as usual, with Ron’s grandson.All the charm, all the wit, all the heart is there—so whatever I (or you) may think about the quality of the book as a whole, it doesn’t matter that much. Everything that makes a Thursday Murder Club book a Thursday Murder Club book is there. There’s just a little less luster than usual.Now that Elizabeth has her groove back (mostly), I expect this to be a minor aberration and that we’ll get back to his usual level.Still, this was about as entertaining as you can want in a mystery—if you haven’t gotten to it yet, fix that.",The Impossible Fortune,2025-05-09T20:21:07.443622,"It’s been a quiet year for the Thursday Murder Club.

In the cult classic novel Bunny, Samantha Heather Mackey, a lonely outsider student at a highly selective MFA program in New England, was first ostracized and then seduced by a clique of creepy-sweet rich girls who call themselves “Bunny.” An invitation to the Bunnies’ Smut Salon leads Samantha down a dark rabbit hole (pun intended) into the violently surreal world of their off-campus workshops where monstrous creations are conjured with deadly and wondrous consequences.

When We Love You, Bunny opens, Sam has just published her first novel to critical acclaim. But at a New England stop on her book tour, her one-time frenemies, furious at the way they’ve been portrayed, kidnap her. Now a captive audience, it’s her (and our) turn to hear the Bunnies’ side of the story. One by one, they take turns holding the axe, and recount the birth throes of their unholy alliance, their discovery of their unusual creative powers—and the phantasmagoric adventure of conjuring their first creation. With a bound and gagged Sam, we embark on a wickedly intoxicating journey into the heart of dark academia: a fairy tale slasher that explores the wonder and horror of creation itself. Not to mention the transformative powers of love and friendship, Bunny.

Frankenstein by way of Heathers, We Love You, Bunny is both a prequel and a sequel, and an unabashedly wild and totally complete stand-alone novel. Open your hearts, Bunny, to another dazzlingly original and darkly hilarious romp in the Bunny-verse from the queen of the fever-dream, Mona Awad.",Mona Awad

In the cult classic novel Bunny, Samantha Heather Mackey, a lonely outsider student at a highly selective MFA program in New England, was first ostracized and then seduced by a clique of creepy-sweet rich girls who call themselves “Bunny.” An invitation to the Bunnies’ Smut Salon leads Samantha down a dark rabbit hole (pun intended) into the violently surreal world of their off-campus workshops where monstrous creations are conjured with deadly and wondrous consequences.

When We Love You, Bunny opens, Sam has just published her first novel to critical acclaim. But at a New England stop on her book tour, her one-time frenemies, furious at the way they’ve been portrayed, kidnap her. Now a captive audience, it’s her (and our) turn to hear the Bunnies’ side of the story. One by one, they take turns holding the axe, and recount the birth throes of their unholy alliance, their discovery of their unusual creative powers—and the phantasmagoric adventure of conjuring their first creation. With a bound and gagged Sam, we embark on a wickedly intoxicating journey into the heart of dark academia: a fairy tale slasher that explores the wonder and horror of creation itself. Not to mention the transformative powers of love and friendship, Bunny.

Frankenstein by way of Heathers, We Love You, Bunny is both a prequel and a sequel, and an unabashedly wild and totally complete stand-alone novel.

Summary:  The Everlasting follows Owen Mallory, a historian who falls in love with the legend of The Knight Sir Una Everlasting and is sent back in time to ensure the story is told correctly. He and Una become “tangled together in time, bound to retell the same story over and over again,” as they try to rewrite her legendary ending.     “ 𝙸 𝚊𝚖 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚜𝚞𝚛𝚎 𝚠𝚑𝚒𝚌𝚑 𝙸 𝚙𝚛𝚎𝚏𝚎𝚛: 𝚝𝚘 𝚋𝚎 𝚝𝚊𝚔𝚎𝚗 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚜𝚘𝚖𝚎𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝙸 𝚊𝚖 𝚗𝚘𝚝, 𝚘𝚛 𝚝𝚘 𝚏𝚊𝚒𝚕 𝚊𝚝 𝚋𝚎𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚠𝚑𝚘 𝙸 𝚊𝚖.”    ▶︎ •၊၊

      ။‌‌‌‌‌ Narration:  Moira Quirk and Sid Sagar are two of my favorite narrators so when I saw they were narrating this one I knew it was going to be a favorite. They do a fantastic job of transporting the reader to a time and place all its own. I highly reccomend the audio, it added so much to an already breathtaking story.     “𝙷𝚘𝚠 𝚏𝚒𝚝𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐, 𝚝𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚖𝚘𝚜𝚝 𝚝𝚎𝚛𝚛𝚒𝚏𝚢𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚒𝚗 𝚖𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚏𝚎 𝚜𝚑𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚛𝚎𝚚𝚞𝚒𝚛𝚎 𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚘 𝚍𝚘 𝚠𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝙸 𝚍𝚘 𝚋𝚎𝚜𝚝: 𝚎𝚜𝚌𝚊𝚙𝚎 𝚒𝚗𝚝𝚘 𝚊 𝚋𝚘𝚘𝚔.”    Thoughts:  The more I continued to read this novel, the more it really reminding me of the relationship between River Song and The Doctor from Doctor Who. Truly my favorite and heart achingly beautiful love story in any piece of media. Every review of The Everlasting has given it high praise and accurately so. It's a genre bending novel that you just can't help but sink your teeth into as you're transported to another time along with Owen Mallory as he bears witness to the Knight he's devoted his life to studying. Through their many lives together you the passion and yearning that is down right palpable. I read this novel in little over 24 hours but I didn't want it to end! I can definitely see myself going back and rereading this probably yearly to remind myself THIS is the way to write a romance. Still in awe of this. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up!

He's a historian, focusing on the folklore of his country, a somewhat failed war hero, hated by his countrymen for looking too much like the enemy, and hated by the enemy for looking like them and being a traitor.When he receives a mysterious ancient text about his country's most famous folk hero, Una the Everlasting, he quietly begins to translate it, but something is wrong. It feels familiar.Too familiar. When he returns home and the text is missing, what he finds in it's place will lead him on a journey across time and space to build a legend to unite a country, and find a love that will survive a thousand years and a thousand lifetimes.This was my 1st Harrow book and all I can say is “wow”. The complexity of the plot and the depth of the characters had me cemented in place with this book for hours.Una and Owen were such excellent characters. Both deep and flawed, the dynamic between the 2 of them was intense and had me dreading the “resets”. I was so invested.The plot was so deep and connected. Everything part of the larger plan. Even the inconsequential details played a role in the story. It didn't take long to realize that those small details mattered and you had to be paying attention to everything to understand just how well woven this was.The prose was absolutely gorgeous. With strong imagery and a deep sense of symbolism for the images that were presented, you could feel yourself pulled in.Again, this was definitely worth the time to read.",The Everlasting,2025-02-14T02:39:24.765516,"From Alix E.

Her prose is gorgeous, and her stories speak straight to my soul.The Everlasting is a tale of a scholar and a lady knight, but it's so much more than that. It's about not fitting into the roles the world expects of you. It's about history and the present, and how stories are told, remembered, and changed over time. It's about love - for a person and for a country - and the lengths we'll go to protect both. I could go on, but at its heart, this is a story about two people tangled together in time and the lasting impact of their choices and stories.I especially loved the structure, how the story is written to Una from Owen and to Owen from Una.

Harrow explores the story of a scholar and reluctant war Veteran, Owen Mallory, and a prolific knight, Sir Una Everlasting as they become bound to revive the same story time and time again to allegedly secure a better, healthier future for their country.“I will wait for you. Beneath the yew.”Honestly, it’s so rude to start the year with a five star read. I have no notes. Over the last two years, Harrow as secured a spot as one of my favorite authors and I think this might be her best work yet (though, if this book didn’t work for you I highly suggest her novella that inspired this book, The Six Deaths of the Saint).This book is slow moving, and therefore are events you will see more than once, but while the plot is obviously important, it’s not really what the book is about. It’s about personhood and free will. It discusses the role of women and womanhood through history and how even when women were able to find successes and power, they had to be painted to fit a certain expectation and risked losing it all with every second. It looks at how people edit history to fit their own agendas and how the strong will always grapple for more strength and power, even when they’ve gained more than their fair share. It looks at how we treat the people we love and the way people can end up hurting those very things for fear of losing them. Surprisingly, it also explores the role of parents and what parents do for their children, what makes someone a parent (including what makes them a good or bad parent). It looks at how children react to their parents within the context of their own knowledge and experiences.Not only are the messages of this book subtle and well done, but the yearning was incredible. If you’re hoping for a quick romance, this isn’t it, but if you can have patience it’s a beautiful and heartbreaking story.The writing itself is wonderful. Harrow does a great job at making her writing flow and have the feeling of being flower without ever feeling bogged down or tiring.I feel conflicted when it comes to the best way to read this book. I really liked the audiobook narration. The narrators were pretty good, but the story is really and back and forth conversation, so having the different voices was nice. However, without spoiling anything, around the mid-point of the book a cipher is mentioned. At the end of the book if you can see the text, the cipher is usable and it was a fun (though unnecessary) added detail that you wouldn’t know about and couldn’t solve if you didn’t have the text in front of you.Something else to note is there some graphic depictions of sexual acts. They’re skippable if that’s something you don’t want to read, and aren’t present throughout most of the story. I will say, as someone who can take it or leave it, they were well done and added to the relationship, especially considering how sparsely they were used.",The Everlasting,2025-02-14T02:39:24.765516,"From Alix E.

The many conflicting stories of her life have made him fall in love with her legend, that of the virtuous and true champion, time and time again. When a book purporting to be the truest story of her life appears on his desk.. then promptly disappears again.. he finds that the history taught is a pale reflection of the woman who inspired it and that he has a greater role in it than he could have imagined. Caught in a cycle of life and death, holding on to each other more and more each time, Una and Owen must try to change history itself, no matter the cost. This was jaw-droopingly good and profoundly poetic. The writing style, a mix of second person story telling with first person narration inserts, fills it with so much heartbreaking personality. The way both the characters have chances to tell their story, to talk about each other, makes it feel like a love letter. An object of devotion and careful chronicling. The subversion of gender roles, the messaging of fighting back against totalitarian oppression, of challenging the appearance of fate, is so very powerful. More than this, the world makes sense - it's really hard to make time travel work in a book in a way that deals with paradoxes cleanly and this does a great job of it. The chronology, despite all the tangles and splitting paths, was entirely easy to follow and by the time we go to the end, I honestly had no idea how it would play out, yet it provided such a satisfying conclusion.

The Everlasting audiobook by Alix E. Harrow, narrated by Moira Quirk and Sid Sagar, is 13 hours and 41 minutes long. It is a tragic, gut-wrenching, ambitious fantasy romance, an ouroboros-like story with no real beginning or end. Both protagonists are trapped within a story that refuses to let go, facing decisions and sacrifices in their pursuit to change their narrative and history.I loved that the first thing that stood out to me between our two main protagonists was how they both defy the standard traditional gender roles for male-female relationships and how complete opposites they are to each other, yet make the most endearing of couples that bring a refreshing new take on traditional fantasy/romantasy stories. Alix's lyrical prose shone in the audiobook, especially with the narrative-heavy format, which helped create a smooth, enjoyable listening experience. As far as the actual performance of the narrators, I will say that they both brought the characters to life and accurately matched the tone and style I imagined for the characters. There was a particular moment when Moira Quirk delivered Sir Una's lines with a resonant and commanding voice, infused with grace and determination, perfectly capturing her essence. Sid Sagar's portrayal of Owen was equally captivating, especially during his emotional monologues, where his voice caught slightly, conveying vulnerability and depth. Their performances didn't distract or take away from the story. Instead, the voices were consistent and helped add that extra layer of personality to our protagonists, while both narrators were able to fully embody all the side characters and deliver on the much-needed moments of comedic relief.Overall, I'd like to thank Netgalley and the publisher for gifting me with a copy of the audiobook because I truly believe that the audiobook enhanced the overall story for me, and I was able to catch the small nuances, parallels, building dread, identity formation, and full-circle moments that made the story overall both enjoyable and memorable. I would recommend this story to anyone who has read and loved The Six Deaths of the Saint or enjoys stories about love and sacrifice, reversed gender roles, and twisted ambition.",The Everlasting,2025-02-14T02:39:24.765516,"From Alix E.

Both deep and flawed, the dynamic between the 2 of them was intense and had me dreading the “resets”. I was so invested.The plot was so deep and connected. Everything part of the larger plan. Even the inconsequential details played a role in the story. It didn't take long to realize that those small details mattered and you had to be paying attention to everything to understand just how well woven this was.The prose was absolutely gorgeous. With strong imagery and a deep sense of symbolism for the images that were presented, you could feel yourself pulled in.Again, this was definitely worth the time to read. ",The Everlasting,2025-02-14T02:39:24.765516,"From Alix E. Harrow, the New York Times bestselling author of Starling House, comes a moving and genre-defying quest about the lady-knight whose legend built a nation, and the cowardly historian sent back through time to make sure she plays her part–even if it breaks his heart.

Sir Una Everlasting was Dominion’s greatest hero: the orphaned girl who became a knight, who died for queen and country. Her legend lives on in songs and stories, in children’s books and recruiting posters―but her life as it truly happened has been forgotten.

Centuries later, Owen Mallory―failed soldier, struggling scholar―falls in love with the tale of Una Everlasting. Her story takes him to war, to the archives―and then into the past itself. Una and Owen are tangled together in time, bound to retell the same story over and over again, no matter what it costs.

But that story always ends the same way. If they want to rewrite Una’s legend―if they want to tell a different story--they’ll have to rewrite history itself.",Alix E. Harrow

Filled with knowledge that only comes from a life fully lived, The Correspondent is a gem of a novel about the power of finding solace in literature and connection with people we might never meet in person. It is about the hubris of youth and the wisdom of old age, and the mistakes and acts of kindness that occur during a lifetime.

Sybil Van Antwerp has throughout her life used letters to make sense of the world and her place in it. Most mornings, around half past ten, Sybil sits down to write letters—to her brother, to her best friend, to the president of the university who will not allow her to audit a class she desperately wants to take, to Joan Didion and Larry McMurtry to tell them what she thinks of their latest books, and to one person to whom she writes often yet never sends the letter.

Sybil expects her world to go on as it always has—a mother, grandmother, wife, divorcee, distinguished lawyer, she has lived a very full life. But when letters from someone in her past force her to examine one of the most painful periods of her life, she realizes that the letter she has been writing over the years needs to be read and that she cannot move forward until she finds it in her heart to offer forgiveness.

It was a moving and delicate experience, with some fierce and poignant moments.Sybil felt real, with flaws and virtues that she acknowledged, fought against and embracedOn the other hand, precisely because everything was narrated through letters, at times the story was slow and slightly underwhelming (i.e. boring) – and that specifically during the first half of the book.Nonetheless, I am not going to lie. At the end of the day, I really appreciated the introspection, the pain, the strength and the overall vibes of the book.The Correspondent took me by surprise with its way of capturing life, love and loss.

Skipper, the youngest, decides that she needs to go and look into Nora's disappearance. Carmen, the middle sister, decides that Skipper needs someone along to look after her.The search for Nora takes Skipper and Carmen across half the world. Sailing through dangerous seas, fending off pirates and shady corporations, and dodging political uprisings,  as they follow the trail.This was an amazing story. It was easy to keep falling into the rhythm of the storytelling each time I had to stop and pick it back up. The world was described so beautifully and it was so well put together. The characters were complex and full of emotion. It was fascinating to see the varying outlooks as the point of view switched throughout the stories.

Skipper, the youngest, decides that she needs to go and look into Nora's disappearance. Carmen, the middle sister, decides that Skipper needs someone along to look after her.The search for Nora takes Skipper and Carmen across half the world. Sailing through dangerous seas, fending off pirates and shady corporations, and dodging political uprisings, as they follow the trail.This was an amazing story. It was easy to keep falling into the rhythm of the storytelling each time I had to stop and pick it back up. The world was described so beautifully and it was so well put together.The characters were complex and full of emotion. It was fascinating to see the varying outlooks as the point of view switched throughout the stories. Each sister had a distinct way of seeing and interacting with the world at large, and it worked really well to shape the story.This was my 1st Kitasei novel, I hope it won't be my last. This is worth the time to read. ",Saltcrop,2025-02-13T10:23:42.022373,"From the acclaimed author of The Stardust Grail comes the epic tale of two sisters who sail across oceans to find their missing third sister―and Earth’s environmental salvation.

1765415,2026-01-27T18:19:47.256612+00:00,"Saltcrop is a really enjoyable sci-fi. Kitasei does some great character work in this book- each of the sisters are SO distinct in their own perspective. You understand where each of them are coming from, why they view others the way they do, and how their relationship with their sisters and family influences their decisions. Honestly, I would LOVE to have a book that follows each perspective in every section- when I’m in Skipper’s POV, I see Carmen one way, but when you’re in Carmen’s POV, you see it completely differently. It’s SO well done. And yes, I would love to have a sequel or even prequels. The future Earth that is portrayed in this book is really interesting, and I loved following the sisters’ journey- I’d be really interested in seeing others. Especially their grandmother, she seems like she’d be a fascinating character to follow.I do have some small issues with it. I really do love the characters, and I enjoyed their journey. It wraps up VERY quickly; however, it does conclude well. I also wish there was a bit more explanation in a few areas- the deliberate vagueness about where they were was a bit irritating at times (I swear they have to be in Norway or other parts of Scandinavia… but seriously it’s set on Earth why be THAT vague). Overall, I’d really recommend this book. The characters are so well written, and the plot is exciting even if it does have some questionable moments.",Saltcrop,2025-02-13T10:23:42.022373,"From the acclaimed author of The Stardust Grail comes the epic tale of two sisters who sail across oceans to find their missing third sister―and Earth’s environmental salvation.

It instantly pulled me in and made me want to read it. This was actually my first Greek mythology read, and overall it was okay for me. The beginning was strong, fast paced, and had me interested, but the middle dragged a bit and I found my attention slipping. Still, I really enjoyed getting to learn more about Medusa’s story, and that version alone made it worth picking up.","I, Medusa",2025-04-22T01:03:36.909361,"Meddy has spent her whole life as a footnote in someone else’s story. Out of place next to her beautiful, immortal sisters and her parents—both gods, albeit minor ones—she dreams of leaving her family’s island for a life of adventure. So when she catches the eye of the goddess Athena, who invites her to train as an esteemed priestess in her temple, Meddy leaps at the chance to see the world beyond her home.

In Athens’ colorful market streets and the clandestine chambers of the temple, Meddy flourishes in her role as Athena’s favored acolyte, getting her first tastes of purpose and power. But when she is noticed by another Olympian, Poseidon, a drunken night between girl and god ends in violence, and the course of Meddy’s promising future is suddenly and irrevocably altered.

Her locs transformed into snakes as punishment for a crime she did not commit, Medusa must embrace a new identity—not as a victim, but as a vigilante—and with it, the chance to write her own story as mortal, martyr, and myth.

1853400,2026-01-08T15:37:10.131916+00:00,"Spotlight on power dynamics, retribution, and the vulnerability of existing.This book was a blur - couldn't put it down. Per usual, I alternated between the physical copy and the audio during my son’s basketball game. It is a compelling retelling that avoids the smut trope and instead dives deep into the psychological reality of being a pawn to the gods.What struck me most was the author’s ability to communicate the internal conflict of trauma. Watching Meddy - who is portrayed here as a genuinely good young woman - navigate the grooming of Poseidon and the betrayal of Athena was devastating. The way Athena's victim blaming, and Meddy's visceral reluctance to speak against her patron, made me understand that specific power dynamic in a way I never quite have before.In a change of pace, I took notes during this one. Arrival at Acropolis: The moment another acolyte feels entitled to touch Meddy’s hair was a sharp nod to body autonomy that still bears repeating.The Sisters: I loved the explicit breakdown of power - the realization that ""power is not given, it is taken."" It’s a meaningful lesson and I'm glad it was explicitly stated. Prior to the explanation, I was kind of into how that dynamic was unspoken but once I read it it occurred to me.. Having this in print is never a bad thing. Say it again for the people in the back.The Tone: It communicates the female experience and the weight of societal station without beating the reader over the head.It’s a powerful story that makes a decently well-known tale feel urgent. While it might not be a reread for me, I will be recommending it to anyone who wants a period mythology retelling with meaningful current-day lessons.One more thing - I love everything that’s included but I adore what was left out, as explained in the afterword.

Not being familiar with mythology, but it seems like whoever thought of the Olympian gods somehow made them a twisted dark version of humanity, everything that is hateful, cruel, and selfish is perfectly embodied in the gods in these pages.Ultimately this is not a bad book just a poorly crafted narrative with some glaring plot holes.

By setting it early in Geralt's life he's able to tell a classic Witcher tale without any lore burdens, and that just works with his minimalist style.

If you start this book, be prepared, buy the second one ahead of time. You will do nothing else but read it until you're at the end and then immediately start the next. Reading this book is like being given all these pieces to a large puzzle through multiple point of views, and each chapter is another piece sinking into place until you start seeing the pictures they form and it's a pop and flash of realization as the whole thing comes together.

It's dangerous, the odds are stacked against them and a mix of secrets and past bad blood surround them, but holy hell is it a ride. They might be young, but the chemistry between characters flows so well, that you don't even doubt what they're doing.
Ketterdam is a merchant's city, where the rich get richer and the poor are stepped on. Kaz, Inej, Nina, Matthias, Wylan and Jesper are all broken or damaged in some way, struggling to survive in this city of the rich. As the story unfolds you will see how each came to be in the dregs of Ketterdam and how even though they each struggle, together they are strong and if they pull of this heist filthy rich.
There's magic, heart wrenching scenes, and too many edge of your seat chapter endings that make this book unable to be put down. The character development is just stunning, watching each character evolve in their own way and fight their own demons was mesmerizing. And the world building! Despite how many different cultures that are introduced nothing is confusing or over done. You're given just enough on each to have it all make sense.

Anyways Stream Shadow and Bone on Netflix.  05.21.17 Update:  Lies I tell myself: I'm sure reading this a second time will be a great idea. You'll definitely won't feel that void in your heart when you finish. Hahaha can I hire Jesper to slay me?  a new, updated review expressing my utter obsession with this book will be coming one day  4.25/5 stars    “The knowledge that they might never see each other again, that some of them—maybe all of them—might not survive this night hung heavy in the air. A gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.”    Ever since its release, I've been hearing non-stop how amazing Six of Crows is. Not once have I ever seen a negative review. Everyone loves Six of Crows.   Everybody.   That isn't even a generalization.  Everybody  loves Six of Crows.  (Have I said everybody enough? I'll say it again just in case. Everybody.) Including me. I have now fallen into the abyss that is  Six of Crows . This book, especially compared to what I've read of  The Grisha Series , blew me away. The characters and the world building and the writing and just everything. It was amazing. However, with all the hype surrounding it, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. I'm not quite sure what it was, and I'll probably never figure it out, but there was something missing. I'm sure that you've heard the plot before, I mean if you haven't then I'm not sure where you've been living? Under a rock maybe? But in case you came out of that rock to read this review, the entire thing can be summarized with the tagline:  “Six dangerous outcasts. One impossible heist.”  It's been a long, long while since I've read a heist book (Shout out to twelve-year-old me who read [b:Heist Society

I'm so used to YA Fantasy books being out a main character trying to overthrow a grumpy old ruler and seizing the throne for themselves, that it is honestly so refreshing to see a twist to that stereotype. Leigh did a great job of making the heist feel impossible from the beginning, as opposed to telling us it is impossible and never showing us, as I appreciated that very much. In fact, I appreciated everything she did with this book.  I'm going to get this out of the way: those stained black pages were absolutely gorgeous. There were times when I stopped reading just to stare at them. Then after about ten minutes, I'd have to snap out of it, wipe away the drool, and continue on reading. God, everything about this book is just so aesthetically pleasing. The characters are what made this book so spectacular. It is rare to find a book that isn't just plot-driven, but also character-driven. Honestly 4/6 of the cast I love so f***ing much I'd probably jump off a cliff if they asked me to, maybe I'd even commit a murder for them. Who knows? The other 2/6 , I'd probably wouldn't kill for, but I'd still like to be best friends with them and maybe we can have sleepovers together or something. I think that would be nice.   “No mourners,” Jesper said...“No funerals,” the rest of the Dregs murmured in reply. Among them, it passed for “good luck.”    Kaz.  Everything I want in a character, and more, was throw together and presented itself in Kaz. He's ruthless, clever, diabolic, intelligent, thoughtful, bad-ass, and more. Just all of the adjectives thrown into one, bloody perfect boy. He now has a very special place in my heart. I applaud Leigh for throwing everything the world has to offer at him, from a tragic childhood (can I just say little tiny Kaz was such a cinnamon roll. I just loved his backstory and the path he ended up taking) to wearing those gloves all the time to a limp, and instead of making it a weakness, turn it into his strength.  Honestly, Leigh took the stereotypical YA protagonist, threw it out the window, and created this beautifully imperfect character that I will cherish forever.

      15093325] too much because I honestly feel like these books are so far apart it isn't fair to compare them, but I'll just say that Alina to Kaz is main character biggest leap I have ever seen from an author. Kaz is very easily in my top ten favorite characters of all time, and I am honestly heartbroken that there is only one more book I have to read that is full of him. Honestly, I'd read anything if Kaz was the MC. Even 50 shades.  Inej.  Inej really surprised me. I didn't really like her at first. I'm not sure why since it was clear from the beginning that she's amazing. But I grew to like her very quickly, and now I don't remember what my life was like before her.  It's kind of a bad habit, but I often compare characters to others I have read/seen before. Usually, I can easily find many comparisons, but Inej was different. There was only one person I could think to even begin to compare her to, and even that's a stretch (her stealth and aerobic training reminded me a lot of Ty Lee from Avatar the Last Airbender, her personality however, did not). Inej was such a new type of character to me, and I loved it. I love her. Kaz loves her. There's this weird love triangle thing happening between the three of us.  Jesper.  I know that Leigh made is clear from the beginning that Jesper was a sharpshooter, but I was about a fourth of the way through this book when I realized there were guns. Guns! A fantasy world with guns! Just more proof that Leigh Bardugo truly made something unique with this book. I liked Jesper, I really did, but he wasn't my favorite character. I enjoyed his development throughout the book, both physically, emotionally, and romantically. Yet, two weeks after finishing Six of Crows, I am struggling to remember specific details about him. I am hoping that when I get around to reading [b:Crooked Kingdom

She didn't have the typical YA appearance, and yet she was still beautiful, flawless, and strong. And everyone in the book knew it. Again, I applaud Leigh Bardugo so much. I'm not the skinniest person in the world, and I was honestly so shocked to see a character like Nina, someone I can picture myself as, while still feeling confident and proud. I'm still a little confused about what exactly she can do with her Grisha powers, but that's not a big deal. I know that she is incredibly powerful and that I don't ever want to get on her bad side.

I don't know why, but the entire time I pretty much pictured Troye Sivan as Wylan. Maybe not Troye Sivan, per say, but the same composure and look of innocence. If that makes any sense? Was it just me? It was probably just me. After Kaz and Nina and Inej, Wylan was another one of my favorites. And we didn't get to see one chapter of him.  I mean, I understand, he can't read, so it wouldn't really make sense. But if Feyre can do it in first person, than Wylan can do it in third.  If that doesn't change in [b:Crooked Kingdom

But anyways, Wylan kind of got thrown into the team with no special skills (well, no special skills that are up to par with everyone else) but he still held his own and made himself a valuable player in the game. Like Jesper, he stole my heart. Quite a shame he kinda felt underappreciated in the story. #TeamWylan Mattias.  What can I say about Mattias? Probably not much. I wasn't the biggest fan.

I just don't trust him fully. I want to give this book five stars so badly. I just wish I could figure out what was missing. I loved everything about it, but yet I just can't bring myself to give it five stars. But, as I said earlier, everybody loves this book and that census now includes me! Yay! I've owned this book for almost a year now, why hasn't anyone forced me to pick it up earlier? Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna go think about how perfect Kaz Brekker is some more.

      Leigh Bardugo
      https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1437274413p2/4575289.jpg], and this book totally lived up to my expectations.Right, so first and foremost, the question I've seen most about this book is whether or not it can be read without having read the Grisha trilogy. The answer is yes—pretty much everything is explained, and the only downside is you'll come across a few spoilers. But if you don't mind, Six of Crows is definitely understandable without previous Grisha universe knowledge.I'll admit the first couple chapters were a little slower than I tend to like, pace-wise, but the story drew me in very quickly after that. I totally loved the vibrant Ketterdam and Fjerda setting, and I thought it was really cool that we got to see parts of the Grishaverse only mentioned in the previous books. The cast of characters are super diverse and I found that each POV (Kaz, Jesper, Inej, Matthias) were really interesting and drew me in for separate reasons, which was great because frequently in multi-POV novels, some POVs are more interesting than others, but I thought these were equally balanced.Then the plot! The whole heist narrative was so ridiculously fun to read—it was incredibly smart and clever and I loved all the twists and wrenches in the plan. It reminded me very much of the Artemis Fowl series, in that the heist plot was super elaborate was unlikely odds and high stakes and the mastermind behind the plan (Kaz) repeatedly impressed me with his ability to think his way out of many problems.And so many ships! I loved all the pairings in Six of Crows and was cheering for every single ship with equal fervor (which, when you have six mains/major characters, is impressive since again, I didn't find myself massively favoring one character or POV over another).And finally, the thing I loved most—hello disabled protagonist in genre fiction! I actually didn't realize Kaz was disabled until after I bought the book, which was a really nice surprise. His disabilities (PTSD and chronic pain that causes a limp and necessitates the use of a cane) were very much part of the story and he didn't require a miracle cure to get around them—Kaz dealt with his disabilities in very real ways and I totally loved how he leveraged his cane to his advantage in various circumstances.All in all, this book hit a home run. If you like fantasy and heist books or just really enjoyed the Grisha trilogy, I couldn't recommend this one more.Now to wait impatiently for September when the second (and final) book, [b:Crooked Kingdom

Format note: I'm sure this book is equally excellent in e-book, but if you're able to get the print hardback, I do recommend it. It's one of the most beautifully designed books I own.

It's a sexy book to look at, and it's an even better book on the inside.There are a lot of YA books these days set in fantasy or sci-fi settings that are all about revolution and dystopia. This isn't one of them. This is about a heist. This is about the game. This is six kids from a rotten part of the world who have lived rotten lives giving a chance at glory their best shot. Yeah, there's a little bit of political machinations, and the effect a new drug may have on a global war, but for the most part you are neck deep in the criminal underbelly of a bustling, Victorianish city, and the street kids who live and thrive there.Each one of the six is captivating, rich and well-drawn. Jesper, the sharp-shooter and gambler; Wylan the wayward son; Nina and Matthias, the soldiers and lovers on opposite side of a war; Inej the circus performer, spider, and survivor of trafficking. Six of Crows bounces between each of their perspectives, and no one is boring or unwelcome. And then there's Kaz. Kaz is just enough. He's a brilliant criminal prodigy, looks good in a suit, refined but not flashy, wicked but not cruel. He is bad, though, make no mistake. Ruthless, alarmingly clever, and just fucking mean sometimes. But you know him, you get him. His flaws are deep ones, down to the bone, and his desires are still human. You can feel good getting invested in him, without feeling bad about loving a sexy teenage criminal who is magically good at everything evil. It's not magic - he's just smart and determined and is carrying vendetta, and Leigh Bardugo is a smart enough writer to know how to do that in the right way.One thing that I found striking about the characters is that while this is YA and they are all teenagers, none of them, with the exception of Wylan and Jesper perhaps, act like it. Which, honestly, is appropriate. For their short amount of years, they have lived very long lives. As such, they treat each other with impressive maturity. Inej and Kaz's relationship, despite all its pining and awkward moments, does not feel like two children experiencing a crush. They love each other, they know that they love each other, but at 17 they're already very grown up and very set on the path of who they're going to be, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to be together. Nina and Matthias have more room for pettiness and conflict, but well, he was raised to see her as an animal, and she sent him to prison. They grow in ways that make sense and raise the stakes of the story, rather than slow the story down.Their epic crime, the one that is so supposed to make them all filthy rich and perhaps even save the world moves fast. There isn't much time spent on maybes. These kids aren't the kind for that anyway. I don't want to say this is filled with twists and turns - like I said, this story is a mature one. Everyone involved knows what they're getting into, and it's hard to say their surprised when they know they have a better chance of dying than succeeding. But they do it anyway. That's what makes this so interesting, and every turn of the page worth your time.",Six of Crows,2025-05-31T03:33:50.794188,"Ketterdam: a bustling hub of international trade where anything can be had for the right price–and no one knows that better than criminal prodigy Kaz Brekker.

The part of the world we get to see if overwhelmingly tragic and dirty, and our protagonists are in that world for reasons that are mostly reasons outside of their control and making the best of their situation. The pacing is delightful, with dramatic moments getting more time to allow your heart to race along with the action. I particularly enjoy the unfolding of mythology of the different characters, leaving aside that each of the protagonists has a different race/mythology and they stick to it pretty well. That is something that you notice but don't have to notice with many fantasy genre books.

It's a well-constructed heist story, set against a compelling world where some people have magical abilities (think air/water/blood/metal bending a la Avatar), and their mostly workaday powers become a pivot point for global conflict. The motley crew assembled to retrieve a vital player from an unbreakable prison all have their own backstories that brought them to this caper, and those stories slowly come to light as the adventure progresses. Each character is well-drawn, and the potential romances and URST add some spice. (This is YA, so nothing more than PG-13, but the tension is artfully written.)This reminds me of [b:Head On

Both use standard storytelling structures (SoC a heist, HO a police procedural), but they use the tropes well, and set them in a world that raises interesting questions about the human condition.

1898835,2023-10-20T04:27:18.680367+00:00,"“No mourners. No funerals.”OMG!!!! WOW!!!! I could go on shouting all the way through my review because that's how I feel after finishing this. Books like Six of Crows are quite rare – dark, intense, violent, gritty, fast paced, full of action and angst – above all pure fun and entertaining. Five stars is too less to rate this book. It's so different from the usual books that I read, I am not sure how I will get out of this hangover and ever like any other book.“The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true.”The world building here is amazing and fantastic and rich, the plot is adventurous but the strength is in the characters. Each of them is a flawed, morally grey person, shaped by the circumstances of their past but most importantly, a survivor. And this ragtag team of six embarks on a mission – to commit an impossible outrageous heist at the heart of the Ice Court in Fjerda and get away with it. If anyone can get out of the mess alive, it is this band of misfits, if they don't kill each other first. So, this review is incomplete if I don't talk about every one of them.“Fine. But if Pekka Rollins kills us all, I'm going to get Wylan's ghost to teach my ghost how to play the flute just so I can annoy the hell out of your ghost.”Brekker's lips quirked. “I'll just hire Matthias's ghost to kiss your ghost's ass.”“My ghost won't associate with your ghost”, Matthias said primly, and then wondered if the sea air was rotting his brain.Jesper the Gambler – He is an impulsive, adrenaline junkie sharpshooter with a sassy mouth, who can't sit still for a minute.“The water hears and understands. The ice does not forgive.”Matthias the Convict – A former Fjerdan witch hunter who is broken out of prison by the gang to help plan the heist. He is angry, and guilty for being hopelessly in love with an enemy he has been trained to hate.“Besides, I have other skills that's bring me more pleasure and profit than this. Lots of other skills.”Wylan coughed. Flirting with him might actually be more fun than annoying him, but it was a close call.Wylan the Wayward Son – He ran away from his wealthy father, no one knows why. Hired as a leverage, he turns out to be extremely smart and skilled with his hands when in need of a big explosive distraction.“She wouldn't wish love on anyone. It was the guest you welcomed and then couldn't be rid of.”Nina the Lost Grisha – Sent out on a mission from Ravka, captured by a witch hunter and now working in a pleasure house, all she wants is to go home, but can't turn a blind eye to the hatred that is meted out to her fellow innocent Grisha.“Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you'll meet a boy who'll learn your favorite flower your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won't matter because he will have taken the time to know as no one else does. Only that boy earns your heart.”Inej the Wraith – She can disappear, she can steal your secrets, she can kill you and you will never see her coming. She is courage epitomized and needs no one to save her, but has her own nightmares which haunt her every step of the way.“Greed is your God, Kaz.”“No, Inej. Greed bows to me. It is my servant and my lever.”And then there is the leader of this crew, the Thief Kaz Brekker – He is driven by revenge but no one actually knows the man, only the legend DirtyHands. He is a thief, a planner and an escape artist. He plays his cards close to his vest, so close that even his team never knows the whole plan. He seems incapable of feelings not borne out of greed but boy, are we wrong. His plans are outrageous, his skills are uncanny and his vengeance is brutal.“I'm not some character out of a children's story who plays harmless pranks and steals from the rich to give to the poor.”I don't think I have ever read a book with six main characters and loved every single one of them. They are all just AWESOMENESS PERSONIFIED .... because I can't think of more words to describe my love for them. I never thought I'll get over the Darkling very soon, but Kaz is just 😍😍😍!!!! I was rooting for him all the way and now, I can't wait to see what devastation he is going to wreak on his enemies. The cocky Kaz is a memorable character but the vengeful version of him is a sight to see and then flee.“Though he'd trusted her with his life countless times, it felt much more frightening to trust her with his shame.”I have to specially mention the writing in this book – it's not just the plot and characters that are superb, the book is full of these wonderful quotable lines that I had to note down, because I don't ever want to forget them. And about the couples in this book – “romance” feels like the wrong word here. I felt their love, their angst, their longing. And the ending is gut wrenching but I know in my heart that Kaz will come out on top at the end.“What do you want, then?”The old answers came easily to mind. Money. Vengeance. Jordie's voice in my head silenced forever. But a different reply reared to life inside him, loud, insistent, and unwelcome. You,Inej.

That must make navigating the nuances of human experience extraordinarily taxing for you.Halfway through, it was feeling a bit better. The pronouns made sense and were in some cases reasonable and interesting choices that contributed to world building. I started to think of the book as a sort of modern Le Guin Hainish cycle book, by way of Miéville's Embassytown, with a bit of Iain Banks's Culture sprinkled in. That felt like pretty high praise, but there was still something that wasn't sitting right with me. It was dragging in places, or felt a little unfocused. Not sure.By the end, I started to appreciate the ambition and scope of the book a little better. I found it to have fairly satisfying ending, and wrapped up a lot of what had felt like dangling ends.In short, I nearly didn't finish the book, and then it gradually made its way to something I would actively recommend.

It's dystopian but doesn't seem too far-fetched to actually happen if the political will was there.There are two narratives in this book: the orphaned triplets, and a girl named Nancy. The orphaned triplets are looked after by 3 women, Mother Morning, Mother Afternoon and Mother Night who faithfully record every aspect of their lives. Nancy lives with her adoring yet controlling parents.The story unfolds slowly, and you start to feel uneasy when you realise things are not what they seem. The two narratives come together near the end and reach a shocking climax, from which the rest of the story and the explanations of what is really going on finishes in a conclusion which leaves you feeling satisfied yet slightly disturbed.Pub Date 22 May 2025Thank you to Net Galley for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for a review.",The Book of Guilt,2025-03-16T17:18:36.548583,"In an alternate world where nobody won WWII, three brothers are the only boys left in an orphanage whose dark secret is the reason for their existence—and the key to their survival—from the acclaimed author of Pet.

After a very different outcome to WWII than the one history recorded, 1979 England is a country ruled by a government whose aims have sinister underpinnings and alliances. In the Hampshire countryside, 13-year-old triplets Vincent, Lawrence and William are the last remaining residents at the Captain Scott Home for Boys, where every day they must take medicine to protect themselves from a mysterious illness to which many of their friends have succumbed.

1814664,2026-01-16T04:14:22.663622+00:00,"Exceptional book. The writing is great—it builds this uncomfortable sense of dread as you read further, slowly revealing the central mystery. The themes of the book are explored so well. The banal cruelty of “normal people,” their capacity for dehumanisation, their willingness en masse to turn a blind eye to uncomfortable realities which serve their interests. It's no accident that this story is set in England, birthplace of modern imperialism. The compatibility shown between the Western liberal democracies and Nazi eugenicist ideology. The hand-waving and idealist babble about “souls”. The imperfect victims. All of these make this book a strong contender for my favourite of the year.",The Book of Guilt,2025-03-16T17:18:36.548583,"In an alternate world where nobody won WWII, three brothers are the only boys left in an orphanage whose dark secret is the reason for their existence—and the key to their survival—from the acclaimed author of Pet.

Her main focus is taking care of her younger sister, and trying to make a better life for her so when her sister is kidnapped by the ‘Nabbers’ who are suspected to be enemy forces, she pledges to bring her back no matter the cost.This was an absolutely phenomenal read and a total wild ride that had me on the edge of my seat towards the end and totally gripped. I didn’t find it at all, predictable, though I did have my suspicions and bad feelings along the way. Meryn is a really powerful protagonist, but also very quick to anger and slow to trust at times.I am so impatient for the next book in this series now, because it was just THAT good.",Dire Bound,2025-07-13T20:38:47.707802,"She’ll risk her life—and her heart—to be one of them.

When her little sister, Saela, is kidnapped—stolen across the border by the immortal monsters her country has spent centuries fighting—Meryn’s world falls apart. 

Desperate to cross the front and save her sister, Meryn enlists in the army and is thrown into the deadly Bonding Trials, where any mistake will cost her life. Now Meryn must survive four months of training at the castle. She is bound to a feral direwolf who refuses to communicate. The other trainees would love to spill her common blood. 

And her cold and beautiful instructor, Stark Therion, is eager to punish any weakness.

1960841,2025-12-27T20:33:30.218772+00:00,"Okay..Will first say that I am sorry to give this rating as I think the authors have potential and their writing, despite this being their first book, is quite well rounded, mature and engaging. The main drawback - and I am shocked this is not being discussed more- is that this is essentially a fan fiction mash up made up 45% of almost directly copied plot points of Fourth Wing, 45% of Throne of Glass and rest 10% are the changes they made to incorporate it into this story.The trials? The bonds with the Direwolves? Their wolves being mated and being able to talk between all 4 of them in a group separate to the packs? You could change some words and this was the Gauntlet, the dragons and Xaden and Violet's communication with the mating bond between Sgaeyl and Tairn.Then we have the lost princess trope whose kingdom had been taken over by a king who is secretly harbouring an ancient being and where they use magic to subdue those they occupy? This is just copy paste Aelin and the Valg.. the king could just be Dorian's father. Unbelievable that other books are being dragged to the mud as being fan fiction based when the authors have turned them into completely different stories (regardless of HP connections - entirely another topic) and this just gets away. 2.5 stars purely because the writing and editing was appropriate for publishing and that despite their heroine being insufferable at times, they actually made her acknowledge in her own thoughts that she was behaving like a toddler.

It seemed like a re-read of Zoe's Tale in particular might have been a good idea. That said I didn't feel lost and there was enough background provided in this book for me to pick up without re-reading any of the previous books.I really enjoyed the main protagonist (who I guess was a character in Zoe's tale?), Gretchen Trujillo and her assistant Ran.

This was such an incredible read. The author’s style was lush and poetic with some great imagery. The horror moments were really were written and properly gory, and the other non horror scenes sometimes had me gagging in disgust (like there’s a scene with wet hair that’s yucky to me). I loved the themes of family, supernatural, racism, grief, mental health, media manipulation and police corruption. I liked the main character, some might find her weak willed but she definitely grew as a character and you can’t help but feel for her. I loved especially the relationship she created with her coworkers. The main mystery itself was interesting and I liked how it was the supernatural parts were interwoven together, but I wish it was paced a bit better. Some scenes felt a bit superfluous too.

1951278,2025-08-14T20:11:15.405469+00:00,"This is one of my most page turning novels I have read so far this year. I have been a fan of Kylie Lee Baker and this novel only adds to my desire to read more of her work.  Be aware this is a COVID pandemic novel and does not shy away from the fear and horrific culture of racism against Asians (like racist arsehats distinguish between Chinese and other Asians minorities) during this period (which still hasn't ended).  Cora Zeng is a biracial Chinese American crime scene cleaner. Some reviewer describe her as a germaphobe, I describe her as someone who is taking perfectly reasonable precautions. Cora grew up with her half-sister Delilah. Delilah's mother is Chinese and she grew up speaking several dialects. Cora struggles with Mandarin, as her mother is white. So already we know Cora struggles with her identity. Fair warning the book begins where her sister is pushed by a racist white man shoving her off a rail platform and Delilah’s head meets a train and this will not be the only horrifically described gory scene in the book. Cora Zeng now works as a crime scene cleaner, and she and her coworkers (who are also of Asian heritage) have noticed a scary pattern of Asian American women being brutally murdered and having bats left at the crime scene.    Oh and Cora thinks her sister is now a hungry ghost.   I also appreciated the well craft twist and the misdirection's that lead up to this twist. So much so I went back a reread the novel to see how well these details had been crafted.  But perhaps Bat Eater’s most remarkable achievement is its seamless weaving of horror with incisive social commentary. It's full of uncomfortable truths: the fetishisation of Asian women. The book includes Cora's observation ""Everyone wants Asian girls to look pretty. No one wants them to talk.” The sharp sting of systemic racism, racially motivated hate crimes, police brutality, media manipulation and copaganda.  Baker handles these topics with both sensitivity and brutality, crafting a narrative that is as unsettling as it is necessary.  Needless to say much of this is confronting and reflecting the horrible racist culture we have in our culture and I can understand why some might not want to read this book. Like Monika Kim's ""The eyes are the best part' this is a remarkable book giving a window into the impact our B.S cultural narratives have on Asian minorities that a lot of non-Asians (like me) would benefit in being forced to confront.

I also didn't appreciate all the body horror and gore stuff; for me it was more of a necessary evil to get to the good parts. And there were many good parts. I have enjoyed not knowing whether the book will have paranormal or ordinary explanations. There were a couple of instances which were really scary, very effective, gave me goosebumps (I had to turn on the lights one time haha but I usually don't read horror so it's hard for me to say how scary it is). Then there's the characters, very easy to relate to and they felt fleshed out, Cora especially. The plot was engaging and the two major plot lines merge together in a way that I figured out at the right time in the book; early enough to feel good about it. Overall, I'm glad to have read this book and I would recommend it to those who are intrigued by the blurb because the book is well executed (there were a couple of things I felt bothered by but nothing major).",Bat Eater and Other Names for Cora Zeng,2025-07-10T10:09:29.397444,"In this explosive horror novel, a woman is haunted by inner trauma, hungry ghosts, and a serial killer as she confronts the brutal violence experienced by East Asians during the pandemic.

It's definitely a must read.",Bat Eater and Other Names for Cora Zeng,2025-07-10T10:09:29.397444,"In this explosive horror novel, a woman is haunted by inner trauma, hungry ghosts, and a serial killer as she confronts the brutal violence experienced by East Asians during the pandemic.

Cora Zeng is a crime scene cleaner, washing away the remains of brutal murders and suicides in Chinatown. But none of that seems so terrible when she’s already witnessed the most horrific thing possible: her sister, Delilah, being pushed in front of a train.

Before fleeing the scene, the murderer shouted two words: bat eater.

So the bloody messes don’t really bother Cora—she’s more bothered by the germs on the subway railing, the bare hands of a stranger, the hidden viruses in every corner, and the bite marks on her coffee table. Of course, ever since Delilah was killed in front of her, Cora can’t be sure what's real and what’s in her head.

She pushes away all feelings and ignores the advice of her aunt to prepare for the Hungry Ghost Festival, when the gates of hell open. But she can't ignore the dread in her stomach as she keeps finding bat carcasses at crime scenes, or the scary fact that all her recent cleanups have been the bodies of East Asian women.

As Cora will soon learn, you can’t just ignore hungry ghosts.

And, personally, I tend to appreciate Indiana Jones-like kind of stories, regardless of the quality.However, I am a bit disappointed with the pace and the lack of mysteries and enigmas. I don’t think this story deserved so many pages, resulting tedious and repetitive at times. I didn’t find the main plot point (“who is looking for Kathrine’s book and why?”) so engaging. And about the other twist (“who is the golem?”), why did the reveal happen so late, with the solution being so clear since the beginning and without any attempt at misdirection?Putting aside the narrative structure for a moment, and without any intent of being controversial, I think Dan Brown tried too hard to explain his pseudoscience. I don’t know much about neuroscience, and even less about noetic. The attempt of building a story around it and, at the same time, of giving (invented?) pseudo scientific details to connect the dots sounded too imaginative and not very credible. When fractals where mentioned I really lost it.These complaints and reservations do not make it a bad novel. As I said, the adventure is fun and engaging most of the time. Just not as good as I hoped.",The Secret of Secrets,2025-01-31T15:14:11.24129,"Robert Langdon, esteemed professor of symbology, travels to Prague to attend a groundbreaking lecture by Katherine Solomon—a prominent noetic scientist with whom he has recently begun a relationship.

But a brutal murder catapults the trip into chaos, and Katherine suddenly disappears along with her manuscript. Langdon finds himself targeted by a powerful organization and hunted by a chilling assailant sprung from Prague’s most ancient mythology.

Many familiar turns and character archetypes that, this time, made their presence too known. Brown's been known to repeat himself, even within a given book. That's noticeably present here.Still, it’s a Langdon novel which I very much enjoy. Brown is great at introducing areas of academia that I inevitably spend weeks reading about in the non-fiction sections of the world. If I were to select one passage I liked most in this book, it was near the end with two female characters discussing the idea that the most common response to a fear is not fight or flight, but selfishness.

""Noetic science"" is a term you'll find nowhere near any reputable scientific institute, serious researchers, or anything else you might consider even ever-so-slightly scientific. You won't find it on Wikipedia either.It's basically a ""faith-based science"", or, in plain words, complete utter bullshit (just like this novel). Brown has his heroine even tell us explicitly that her ""science"" should be exempted from any kind of burden of proof because that’s simply too high a bar... An ""experiment"" that succeeded once, the results of which have not been reproduced in decades, should be taken at face value instead. That's Trump, MAGA, and Kennedy ""science"".Yes, the novel is suspenseful - if you disengage your brain and just follow our pair of professors-cum-action heroes and the mysterious and murderous ""Golem"" along on their unlikely and unbelievable ride.

Beyond the puzzles and high-stakes race to the finish, the exploration of human consciousness and the implications of advancing science in this space genuinely had my mind reeling. I found myself wanting to pause just to Google things and go down research rabbit holes—which, to me, is a sign the book is doing something interesting.It’s still very much a Dan Brown thriller, but it asks bigger, more unsettling questions than usual.

1788666,2023-12-27T11:03:30.764935+00:00,"""A great meter is no mere implement, like pen or typewriter, but a keyboard a young poet learns to master, exploring its range and subtleties, stretching its capabilities of harmony and expressiveness. Merely to accept the meter as given by one's predecessors, to write one's verses “in” iambic pentameter, is to assist at the death of a metrical form and perhaps one's own poetry. The demise of iambic pentameter as the chief meter of English poetry probably owes much to its coming to be understood even by poets themselves as an available prosodic form, a meter to write poems “in,” a Roman road, rather than as a kind of heroic adventure or even a haunted house.""[1]Melville's Moby-Dick: or, the Whale is like the “Roman road” for the English novel. It's wildly inventive, riotously funny, excellently written, has an almost mystical sense of atmosphere, introduces one of the most transcendentally fascinating characters in the whole of world literature in Captain Ahab. And above all, it's simply a great joy to read.2The greatest novels in the English language are not only excellent narratives; they enrich the language and show its beauty. They're exhilarating, they energize, they inspire. Melville's Moby-Dick certainly fits the bill, and only McCarthy's Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (1985) has recently come close to replicating said grandeur of reading, and in many ways I believe it's a worthy companion to this book. They go hand in hand, and for this reason I invoked Wright's quotation. Melville is so all-encompassing here it's difficult not to think of Moby-Dick as an emblem of creative writing. I think Joyce's Ulysses (1922) is the logical continuation of the inherent complexity of Melville's thought, something we might call modernism. In Moby-Dick there's a sermon, essayistic, encyclopedic descriptions of whaling, sudden leaps into play acting, multiple points of view in narration, soliloquies. And the feeling one has is that all of this belongs there and without which it wouldn't be Moby-Dick. That's a sign of a great novel: that there's no superfluity, everything belongs, every particular creates the essentials.[3]And then there's Captain Ahab. “He's full of riddles”, says Stubb after being told off by the Captain, and that's exactly what so fascinates in him. Cormac McCarthy definitely modeled Judge Holden after Ahab, so alike are the two with their diabolical and mystical aura. They're mere men but still beyond the narrative. His grandness is Shakespearean[4] It's boisterous, energetic, mesmerizing.The Penguin that I own is quite nice, it has a good introduction and some supplements at the back: a list of variants between editions, annotations as well as maps and images. The annotations at their very best give insight into Melville's writing that becomes essential in reading the novel. Such is the gloss on Ahab's “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”: “Melville remarked in a letter to Hawthorne (June 29, 1851) that this is the secret ‘motto' of the book.”I have also listened to an audiobook version of the book, narrated by Frank Muller. It's one of the best audiobooks I've heard. He reads it a bit fast at times, but it's his rhythm and the voices he produces that make it so utterly enjoyable.Endnotes:[1] George T. Wright, Shakespeare's Metrical Art, 18.[2] I know there are people who would rathe jump out of the window than read it, so there.[3] Again I hear somebody trying to jump out the window.[4] “I'd strike the sun if it insulted me” in chapter 36; “What I've dared, I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer” in chapter 37.2 October, 2011",Moby Dick,2025-02-27T10:17:39.777591,"""Command the murderous chalices! Drink ye harpooners!

I have a vivid memory of him coming into my bedroom when I was about 6, and my brother 10, years of age insisting that we read it. However, upon seeing the depth of the book, I was immediately intimidated. It was only after my father’s death a couple years ago that I felt compelled to carry out my father’s wish of about three decades prior.I am very conflicted. As a book it feels very disjointed; one part story, the other part academic, mashed together and related by theme but otherwise seemingly separate. I like both parts independently, but not together.Additionally, I find Melville’s writing to be redundant, and not in a “oral storytelling tradition” sort of way, but rather in that he used multiple synonyms to describe the same thing. This seems highly inefficient, despite the actual prose being wonderfully poetic.The characters are incredibly memorable, and well fleshed out. I was connected to each one, my favorite being the kind and loyal cannibal, Queequeg.I am sure that once I dive deeper into understanding the symbolism and themes present in the book I will grow a deeper appreciation and respect for it, but currently I can not fathom someone reading this for leisure in 2024.",Moby Dick,2025-02-27T10:17:39.777591,"""Command the murderous chalices!

This being so, I, prepared to read a legendary classic and unaware of the Goliathan task before me, embarked upon a thee month navigation of dense prose which, in the end, I juggled with five other books; Stoker’s gothic masterpiece Dracula, for I am subscribed for the Dracula Daily newsletter; Crummey’s Sweetland, a novel I read with utmost haste to catch its adaptation ere it departed the silver screen; the aforementioned Dune Messiah, which I began late one evening when, finding myself tucked snugly in my bed and missing my copy of Moby Dick, I reached for the nearest book I had on hand; and ultimately God’s own Holy Bible, which I began reading for the express purpose of understanding the myriad of biblical references Miller employs. Nor was my reading in any way hastened — or indeed unimpeded — by the twisting, winding sentences one must reread twice ere grasping fully; a poetic labyrinth of prose one cannot parse without losing oneself of times; and the White Whale himself more terrible, more loathsome than any mere bull-headed Minotaur that Pasiphaë could muster!

Author narrates audio.,Mother Mary Comes to Me,2025-07-02T19:48:22.104694,"A raw and deeply moving memoir from the legendary author of The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness that traces the complex relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a fierce and formidable force who shaped Arundhati’s life both as a woman and a writer.

Mother Mary Comes to Me, Arundhati Roy’s first work of memoir, is a soaring account, both intimate and inspirational, of how the author became the person and the writer she is, shaped by circumstance, but above all by her complex relationship to the extraordinary, singular mother she describes as “my shelter and my storm.”

“Heart-smashed” by her mother Mary’s death in September 2022 yet puzzled and “more than a little ashamed” by the intensity of her response, Roy began to write, to make sense of her feelings about the mother she ran from at age eighteen, “not because I didn’t love her, but in order to be able to continue to love her.” And so begins this astonishing, sometimes disturbing, and surprisingly funny memoir of the author’s journey from her childhood in Kerala, India, where her single mother founded a school, to the writing of her prizewinning novels and essays, through today.

With the scale, sweep, and depth of her novels, The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, and the passion, political clarity, and warmth of her essays, Mother Mary Comes to Me is an ode to freedom, a tribute to thorny love and savage grace—a memoir like no other.",Arundhati Roy
1940646,2025-12-29T06:16:46.935004+00:00,"“I was trained, from a very young age, not to respond, to hold it all in.” If there was a Pulitzer for memoirs in India, this was a sure contender. It has been more than 20 years when I read The God of Small Things and I had almost forgotten how beautiful Arundhati Roy's writing can be. In this memoir, Arundhati Roy looks back at her life from the perspective of her relationship with her mother Mary Roy.“She taught me to be free and then raged against my freedom.”It tells the story of how a precocious girl growing up under the harsh dominion of her mother, became Arundhati Roy, an architect, a scriptwriter, a reluctant actor, an acclaimed author and a voice against various oppressions plaguing India.What is most admirable for me is that after winning the Booker prize in 1997, she stopped writing fiction for many years and became a vocal activist. She was one of the first to raise the alarm bells against the rise of right-wing Hindu nationalists. She could have easily got a new book contract, moved abroad, and would have kept writing stories. Instead, she stood up against the authority, against the government, against the courts, against the big corporations. She was different from the beginning and later she was labelled as a commie. She fought for the Narmada river, she spoke and wrote about the marginalized, and walked with the Naxalites deep in the forests. She is a well-known figure in India but in this book she fills in the gaps in her story. She talks about her friendships and relationships with candor. We get to know why she dropped ‘Suzanna' from her name and became Arundhati Roy. She tells the story of growing under the fearful ‘regime' of her mother Mary, a visionary educationist - her ‘gangster'.  “There was indisputably a light coming out of her school and her mission,” Roy says, “but for her to shine that light, my brother and I had to absorb the darkness.” Left on her own from a young age, forced to find odd jobs to pay for her education and living expenses, she struggled but felt liberated and even after achieving success never subscribed to what was ‘expected' of her. She was never a conformist. “While I have nothing against convention, I have a manifesto that says, you don't have to do the conventional thing.” Probably the best book of 2025.",Mother Mary Comes to Me,2025-07-02T19:48:22.104694,"A raw and deeply moving memoir from the legendary author of The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness that traces the complex relationship with her mother, Mary Roy, a fierce and formidable force who shaped Arundhati’s life both as a woman and a writer.

I forgot how much I enjoyed that book, despite the ending. And now, after reading Mother Mary Comes to Me, I see where so many of those characters came from, what inspired them.

Enter the time space, a soaring library filled with books containing the memories of those have passed and accessed only by specially made watches once passed from father to son--but mostly now in government hands. This is where eleven-year-old Lisavet Levy finds herself trapped in 1938, waiting for her watchmaker father to return for her. When he doesn't, she grows up among the books and specters, able to see the world only by sifting through the memories of those who came before her.

You have to look after it, and it will look after you.""I feel like there's a good book in here, or the good idea of a book, but I wasn't sold on some of the decisions made by the main character for the sake of the plot, and the worldbuilding left a lot to be desired. I really loved the idea of this astral library outside of time housing people's memories, but it seemed under described, under utilized, and kind of a letdown.Lisavet is a girl out of time. Her father, owner and creator of magical timepieces that allow the user to access a vast library of memories, deposits her there to keep her safe during Kristallnacht, swears he'll come back for her, and never does. She's trapped without a watch of her own to get back, and thus grows up in the stacks of this mysterious library. Other people have access to this library, timekeepers who enter the library to burn books of memories, but Lisavet soon makes it her mission to preserve these memories that others want destroyed. It's through this saving of burning books that she meets Ernest, a timekeeper for the Americans, working under Jack, head of the timekeeping organization. As is the way of these things, the two become lovers, until Lisavet learns some ugly truths about the American timekeepers organization and a miscommunication (ugh) drives the two apart.So I loved Lisavet and her goals in the beginning of the book, even if the burning of the books of memories aren't well explained. Even Ernest, after Lisavet and him become an item, doesn't seem to be able to explain why the timekeepers do what they do, except some vague notion about nation sovereignty. Preserving memories/books/whatever just appeals to me. But Lisavet's character and motives entirely changes after (major plot spoilers here) she has Amelia. Suddenly she's this ruthless, heartless killer of memories, all in the name of keeping Amelia safe. It just rings hollow late in the book. I know it's supposed to show the lengths she's willing to go to for Amelia, but some of the things she does is downright horrible, and I'm not sold on the abrupt nature of her character shift. It's kind of telling when I was commenting early on in the book about how much I loved Lisavet as a character and how much I hated Moira.I didn't think the library was all that well explained, and as I've mentioned here already, nothing seemed well explained. The magic/memory system seems handwavy with rules and limitations only when convenient and no real grasp of why the timekeepers were doing what they were doing. Jack as a villain was the most villainest of villains, very flat as a character, which is unusual when the author took such care with Lisavet, Ernest, and Amelia. I did love how the author did dialogue and internal thoughts, very descriptive and moving, but anything external, like a scene or descriptors or anything seemed lacking. The time jumps between characters was also jarring in places, particularly near the end when things started converging. I got really confused as to who/which character was the POV character and when sometimes when listening to the audiobook.The love story between Ernest and Lisavet was sweet, however, and I did like how they always managed to find each other again. I just wish the rest of the book held up to keep me interested.",The Book of Lost Hours,2025-02-17T22:17:13.734641,"For fans of The Ministry of Time and The Midnight Library, a sweeping, unforgettable novel following two remarkable women moving between postwar and Cold War-era America and the mysterious time space, a library filled with books containing the memories of those who bore witness to history.

1775705,2026-01-11T02:57:38.240276+00:00,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but I was pleasantly surprised by this story! A fun blend of historical fiction and sci-fi, this story had a lot of whimsy and high-stakes that kept me engaged and anticipating the next chapter.This book splits its timeline, following Lisavet Levy in 1938, where she's hidden by her father into the time space, a library where all memories from the past are stored inside of books. While she escaped Kristallnacht, she's left trapped in this strange place and spends her adolescence walking through the memories of those that have lived before her. Lisavet soon discovers that government agents from a variety of countries are also entering the time space, destroying some of the books it contains, and takes it upon herself to preserve the memories of those lost to time. Also, Amelia Duquesne is living in 1965, mourning the death of her uncle and guardian, where she's approached by the CIA's Temporal Reconnaissance team. Amelia is told about the time space, in an effort to recover a book her uncle had been searching for. This truly was a fun book! The time space is such a unique idea as a compendium of human memories, and the inclusion of government interference rings true, especially with the settings of the book. I found Lisavet to be an interesting character, with such a range of growth and personal change as she grows up in the time space. There were a couple character interactions that seemed a bit obvious by the time they came up (there's a twist partway through), but I loved how this story concluded.I received an advanced copy of this book from Simon & Schuster Canada, all opinions are my own.",The Book of Lost Hours,2025-02-17T22:17:13.734641,"For fans of The Ministry of Time and The Midnight Library, a sweeping, unforgettable novel following two remarkable women moving between postwar and Cold War-era America and the mysterious time space, a library filled with books containing the memories of those who bore witness to history.

It's a dense story with a lot going on but it's interesting and engaging enough that you don't get distracted. Definitely some twists I didn't see coming, although for some of the others I guessed correctly. I struggled a little with Moira's character as the book went on, and she might not always have been likeable but I definitely understood her motives. There was hope in this story, and love, but there were plenty  of heavy themes and grim events so some of it felt a bit emotionally draining. And yet, I  still wanted to see how it ended. I am glad I stuck with it, I'm still thinking about it the next day which is always my personal sign for a good book. I think it's obvious based on the book description, but please check trigger warnings as there is some potentially triggering content for some readers. I thought this was an interesting take on the dangers of revisionist history. I could see this being turned into a movie, there's something very cinematic about all of it. This is not my usual type of read since I tend to favor rom-coms, but I think the blend of fantasy, history, and romance will appeal to a lot of readers. Publishes August 26, 2025.

Acaelus has had several identities, and is shifting to the latest - Durzo Blint, assassin. This is the story of Durzo's (and Acaelus') origins.I liked Brent Weeks' Night Angel trilogy, and I've been interested to know more about how it all started. The Perfect Shadow provides a very small taste of the answer.The Perfect Shadow reads more as a collection of scenes than as a short story. In fact, one might suspect it of being composed largely of the author's background character sketches, loosely tied together. It provides the answer to why Acaelus/Durzo became a wetboy (assassin), but in a strangely unsatisfying way. While the story is told from Acaelus' point of view, there's very little introspection. It's a classic case of telling and not showing, so that while we know he's upset about losing wife after wife to age and violence, we don't really feel what he's feeling.All in all, it's a mildly interesting addition to the series, and only for fans.

I loved the interactions between the two main characters and enjoyed the push/pull of their relationship as they find themselves with this bond that physically leaves them unable to be apart and while it could feel a rather too insta lust/love I didn't feel this at all and just enjoyed seeing them slowly learn to care for the other. I will say it did kind of slow down on pacing around the 40% for me and I found some moments a little too repetitive at times but the second half completely picked up and the ending has me excited to see where the story will take us in book two!

She's also a siren. She keeps the to herself though, because the king happens to be a hunter of sirens (and proud of it) and so being small and unthreatening to survive is what she relies on. When a tall handsome king of a land across the water shows up at a ball, she finds it a pretty good excuse to get the hell out of there. As she finds her way to the new kingdom and has to content with new magics, political pressures, and creepy mage seers, she realises that fate may have far more in store for her than she original imagined. This was an amazing story with fantastic world building. The romance was slow burn and complex, with a lot of warring feelings. There's not just a one-bedroll trope, but also a one-horse trope, and plenty of steamy forbidden love. I absolutely devoured this and I can't wait for the continuation of the story. Thoroughly recommend! ",In the Veins of the Drowning,2025-01-03T18:13:26.405128,"The monster is always slain…

1980442,2025-11-03T12:42:42.279992+00:00,"Summary: The previous case continues to unfoldI am a long term fan of the series. Most of the books I have read more than once. But starting at about the eighth book there has been a shift from a mystery series to a thriller series. There are some books in the last dozen that have had more mystery elements than thriller elements, but most of those books have shifted from mysteries where Gamache and those around him follow clues and psychologically gain an understanding of the perpetrator, to thriller elements where the point is unfolding tension. Along with that thriller element, a natrual shift has been to make Gamache more and more of a traditional hero.Part of what I loved is that the early books portrayed Gamache is using his brain, his love of others, the empathy he gained from his own tragic history and his experience with previous cases to solve crimes. But a lot of the recent stories have been focused on action hero tropes, luck, or the willingness of Gamache to bend the rules to stop others who have no regard for the rules. I am glad for series like this to grapple with the moral complexities of any job. And police work has plenty of moral complexities. And this series has grappled with the ways that bending rules because you think you are in the right can lead to bending rules because the rules are getting in your way. One of the things that gets tedious in John le Carré's books is that there are often no characters that are actually doing the right thing for the right reasons. It is all about power. There may be some realitiy to that, but it doesn't make for very compelling reading.As the Gamache books have become more about conspiracy theories and less about crime, they fall into the trap of needing to be larger and larger conspiracies. This is a spoiler, but there is an author's note at the beginning that hints at the spoiler because the book was written prior to the most recent US Presidental election even if it wasn't published until Oct 2025. Early in Trump's presidency there was a lot of language about Canada becoming the 51st state of the US. The story here is about a conspiracy to invade Canada, or maybe a conspiracy to invade the US by Canada. Or maybe all of that is a ruse for other purposes. At times this feels a bit too ""ripped from the headlines.""As it is, I think it is a fine thriller. It is really the second part of a two book arc, and I am not convinced that there won't be a third book in the arc. But even if it is a fine thriller, much of the elments of the series that I love, the people, the character development, the complex portayals of characters that I have grown to love are missing. While Jean-Guy Beauvoir and Isabelle Lacoste are all throughout the book, they feel more cardboard than normal. They have become arms of Gamache more than indpendent characters.I will keep reading Louise Penny, but I do wish she would return to the smaller, cozy style that was the reason I started reading her.This was originally posted on my blog at https://bookwi.se/black-wolf/",The Black Wolf,2025-07-22T12:42:51.795542,"Several weeks ago, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec and his team uncovered and stopped a domestic terrorist attack in Montréal, arresting the person behind it. A man they called the Black Wolf.

But their relief is short-lived. In a sickening turn of events, Gamache has realized that plot, as horrific as it was, was just the beginning. Perhaps even a deliberate misdirection. One he fell into. Something deeper and darker, more damaging, is planned. Did he in fact arrest the Black Wolf, or are they still out there? Armand is appalled to think his mistake has allowed their conspiracy to grow, to gather supporters. To spread lies, manufacture enemies, and feed hatred and division.

Still recovering from wounds received in stopping the first attack, Armand is confined to the village of Three Pines, leading a covert investigation from there. He must be careful not to let the Black Wolf know he has recognized his mistake. In a quiet church basement, he and his senior agents Beauvoir and Lacoste, pore over what little evidence they have.

To start with, I loved that it was following an Irish family and was set partly in Ireland, as l'm also Irish (albeit from the north) so it was really nice to read. Although I am not personally religious, I was intrigued to read about Ferdia potentially being canonised as a saint, and Jay's complicated feelings around this. Ferdia was a lovely character in everyone's stories but it really made me sad to see how emotionally neglected Jay was throughout her childhood, and how long it took to partly heal with her parents, especially after Ferdia's death.There was a sad bit in the last few chapters I won't spoil but it shocked me and I felt that it added a bit more depth to the story and certain surrounding characters.It's a beautiful read, following the impacts of the Catholic Church on Irish families (and others), with mentions of the church's attitudes towards women and queer people, and also mentions of the Magdalene Laundries, which were heartbreaking and devastating parts of our history.",Ordinary Saints,2025-01-06T09:03:48.850584,"An arresting, unmissable debut novel shortlisted for the Women's Prize Discoveries award - an exploration of family, grief, queer identity, and the legacy of the Catholic Church in Ireland.

These question and the big revelations surrounding them were not all that shocking at all and easily predictable I found even for those who don't have a strong foundation in scientfic way of thinking.

There was also one of the interviews where someone described themselves as “a space scientist”, which, wut?It was good enough fluff, but any of the previous Langdon books are better.eta: I was reminded about another issue I had with this when I saw a meme on Facebook. There's a part where Langdon's written a problem out in Greek and asks the woman if it's correct or not. It turns out that from her angle it's wrong and his it's right! And he explains that it's all in perspective, yada yada. No. The problem is either right or wrong.

Skal sies at jeg slukte Da Vinci-koden, og at Engleder og demoner har en del meget gode trekk, men gode bøker? Ikke helt. Og det er heller ikke Origin. Til det er det alt for mange indre motsigelser, tullete handlingstvists og inkomprehensible utsagn og valg som bokens karakterer gjør eller mumler på spanglish underveis. Origin handler om de virkelig store spørsmålene; Hvor kommer vi fra, hvor skal vi hen, og hva er relasjonen mellom mennesket og teknologien? De to første spørsmålene prøver Dan Brown i tillegg å gi svar på, og (spoilervarsel): Du får faktisk et svar! Men godeste Brown legger opp til at det virkelig store svaret er svaret på det siste spørsmålet, hvor skal vi hen - mens det som faktisk kan være interessant for en reflekterende leser som er opptatt av forholdet mellom religion og vitenskap, er svaret på det første spørsmålet. At svarene som gis utfordrer verdens religiøse institusjoner er opplagt, og det er egentlig dette boken handler om. Underveis besøker vi spennende lokasjoner som Guggenheim-museet i Bilbao (Verd et besøk i levende live også), Sagrada Familia i Barcelona (verd å stå to timer i kø for å se? Vet ikke, jeg gadd ikke), Madrid og Sevilla - og vi får et ganske så solid innblikk i polemikken mellom nyateister som Harris, Dawkins og Hithcens og kirkelige kirkens tenkere, blant annet Augustin. Så som en slags dannelsesreise er dette ikke så verst. Men skrivingen da? Og at alle interne refleksjoner og tankespinn hos ALLE ALLTID SKAL SKRIVES I KURSIV kan være grunn til innleggelse på nærmeste psykiatriske institusjon for denne leser.

1843574,2024-01-04T18:45:22.585042+00:00,"2.5 out of 5 starsDespite Philip Pullman's pronouncement that this is book is an “equal” (not a prequel or sequel) to His Dark Materials, this first volume is most definitely a prequel. In fact, it's so firmly set on creating additional backstory for His Dark Materials characters that it leaves little room for new characters and storylines to shine. I would have much preferred a brand new story set in the familiar world, where known characters and events are merely mentioned in passing...but here we are.The Book of Dust follows tavern boy Malcolm Polstead and his trusty canoe La Belle Sauvage, as he journeys to aide/protect baby Lyra from the oppressive religious agencies set to snatch her away. He encounters several familiar characters from the original series along the way.Pullman's writing evokes storytelling of a bygone era. Apart from (occasionally heavy-handed) allusions to present day authoritarian regimes, there is very little here that identifies this as a novel written in contemporary times. It makes it seem like a timeless story and I very much enjoy that aspect of Pullman's style.Overall, though, this feels like a missed opportunity to chart new territory in an established world. I hope the future novels divert further away from the known storylines and allow Malcolm to leave the baggage of the original novels behind.See this review and others at The Speculative Shelf.",La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One,2025-04-16T10:02:52.059116,This book is set ten years before The Golden Compass and tells the story of how Lyra came to be living at Jordan College.,Philip Pullman

As is, it felt like it referenced a lot of exposition in the series without really building up the universe in the same way. In fact there were even times when I was wondering “Where is Malcolm's daemon?” In some sections is almost felt like Asta was forgotten. Malcolm and Alice are great characters, I would love to see more of their story. I loved infant Lyra and seeing what baby daemons are like.However, the second half of the novel is a long canoe ride through a dreamy flooded British landscape, all while being chased by a lunatic and his increasingly maimed and tortured daemon. They find a witch, a faerie and some sort of weird purgatory party. It felt like it dragged on, and then the ending when they are finally rescued felt incredibly rushed. We never see Malcolm reunited with his family or Dr. Relf for example, instead we just have Lord Asriel telling them to go back to the Trout, as he drops Lyra off at the University.",La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One,2025-04-16T10:02:52.059116,This book is set ten years before The Golden Compass and tells the story of how Lyra came to be living at Jordan College.,Philip Pullman

1843574,2024-04-30T21:29:13.709874+00:00,"I...don't know.  I might come back and give more points later.  But His Dark Materials together are probably the most formative books in my life, and the bar might just be too high.  Golden Compass was Just Another Fantasy novel when I read it, about the same time that Subtle Knife came out.  But the six months between reading Golden Compass and Subtle Knife were very formative in my life (it was the transition from middle to high school) and so in many ways, reading Subtle Knife is deeply and fundamentally associated with starting to see symbolism in books, starting to ask existential questions about myself.  Amber Spyglass was published just after my freshman year of college, and I read it multiple times back-to-back that summer, pondering the purposes of existence.  Two years later, I saw each half of the stage production multiple times in the London National Theatre, and did the backstage tour twice.  I have signatures of all of the actors.  The altheiometer inset is framed on my wall, and  it's not a coincidence that my avatar here is an altheiometer.  HDM really formed who I am, how I interact with the world and how I read.La Belle Sauvage, for now, at least, is Just Another Fantasy Novel.  I have some specific concerns: the female characters have basically no agency (a major disappointment, after Lyra); the antediluvian portion of the novel really drags, with a few Whizbang!Fantasy moments but no real depth and the opportunity to use Daemons and worldbuilding to make the villain hair-raisingly creepy instead of just lazily using rape to signal moral corruption was passed over.  But honestly, I could overlook all of those.  My biggest disappointment was that there just wasn't much there there.  I don't know if it's me – that I'm older and less malleable by a book – whether this book really is shallow, or whether it's set-building and the best is yet to come...",La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One,2025-04-16T10:02:52.059116,This book is set ten years before The Golden Compass and tells the story of how Lyra came to be living at Jordan College.,Philip Pullman

Maddie Kowalczk is ready to be a bad girl. When the rookie lecturer lands at Astra University, she’s looking to start fresh after a messy breakup. But her first night in town takes a twist when she bumps into Bram Loe—a reserved but incredibly handsome single dad she (not so accidentally) stole a parking spot from earlier that day. The unspoken chemistry as he locks eyes with her while she gets a birthday spanking at a local bar is hotter than a Bunsen burner at full flame.

Bram is looking for a break from his hectic life as an ecology professor and dad to rambunctious twins and a busy teenager. So when his college friend’s divorce celebration brings him face-to-face with the same delectable brat who stole his parking spot, he’s ready for a night to remember. But the next morning, Bram’s world turns upside down (and that’s not just the hangover talking). His new nanny? None other than Maddie, who also happens to be the new poli-sci adjunct at the university where he teaches. 

Maddie is desperate and broke, so when Bram offers her a raise and the chance to set some ground rules, she can’t say no. As the two settle into their new roles, the normally unruffled Bram finds that no one riles him up like Maddie does, which is a problem when every argument feels like foreplay. Of course, Bram is an educator first and foremost, and he very quickly finds he can’t resist the temptation of instructing Maddie in the fundamentals of being a good girl. 

And it turns out Maddie’s a hands-on learner…

She's also the brat Bram spanked the night before and spent an unforgettable night with.That complicates things.Overall, I liked the book although I couldn't focus on the most part. First of all, the prologue starts with a pov from a random friend we still don't know anything about (except the fact that he has many many children). Which is a shame because I'd rather read in detail how Maddie stole Bram's parking spot and their one-night stand from his point of view. Not from Joey's who heard a recount from Bram.But I digress.I loved both Maddie and Bram, they were both super fan. The spice was hot, although it became boring after a while. I don't know why, but I mostly just skipped paragraphs during their scenes unless there was dialogue. I get why there were so many scenes - they advanced the relationship etc, but for me personally, it just felt like too much.The setting worked and I enjoyed the plot for the most part, although Maddie's political ambitions came out of left field. It was just so random. Plus, the ending didn't really make sense: first, they talk about how morally grey Veronica is, and how unethical and that Mddie should stay away from her. And then she suddenly works for her and wants to be like her, and all characters are suddenly okay with that???  It just felt weird.Also, I couldn't figure out where was Maddie supposed to be from. Her name is Kowalczk which sounds like a Polish name, but I can tell you, it's not. I'm Polish. There's no Kowalczk last name here. Kowalczyk (with an y)? Yes, absolutely, one of our most famous and successful cross-country skier is called Kowalczyk. But Kowalczk? I can tell you that even though it sounds Slavic, it's not a real word. It looks like a typo.And I haven't read Nolan's book so I have no idea if that was ever explained either.That being said, I enjoyed the book even if I found it boring at times. I also loved the background characters who made this book: the twins, Fern, and the Andromedas. And I hope that each Andromeda also gets their won book!Especially Leo. Leo, a former bully turned a billionaire asshole (with a heart of gold) who doesn't care about people unless it's hsi people: Andromedas, and their kids. And Junie. Oh, I hope they get their own book!Also, I want him to finally meet the mysterious Cole. Is he going to be a character who finally appears in the book or is he going to be a figure who haunts Leo's sanity? Either way, I can't wait.All in all, I liked the book, it was funny, well-written (i loved the annotations!), and Ihad fun.

I genuinely hate giving one-star ratings—someone put real heart into this story—but unfortunately, it missed the mark for me.As a New Jersey native, I really wanted to love a Harlan Coben project. The premise had ""bones"" and genuine promise, but the execution struggled, especially in audio form. The narration felt uneven; at times it was engaging, but too often it felt over-explained, as if the story didn’t trust the listener to keep up.A major hurdle was the casting. Reese Witherspoon is iconic, but I found it impossible to separate her voice from Legally Blonde. Instead of sinking into Maggie’s world, I kept hearing Elle Woods, which pulled me out of the tension. Ultimately, this felt like a screenplay in disguise. I suspect the pacing and heavy-handedness would smooth out on screen, but as an audiobook, I finished it feeling indifferent—and for a story with this much potential, indifference is the sharpest disappointment of all.",Gone Before Goodbye,2025-06-07T22:45:16.828797,"An unforgettable suspense novel that combines the storytelling talents of Academy Award-winning actor Reese Witherspoon and internationally bestselling author Harlan Coben.

The yearning. I NEED A MOMENT.This book may be the reason I start annotating. Because after my experience I'm left with a haze of impressions, thoughts, and hurt feelings. When I tell you this book was a maelstrom of feeling things I haven't felt while reading a book in a LONG time...there were a couple of chapters where you could not have ripped this book out of my cold dead fingers. There were times where Essiya for real scared the sheet out of me. Like where did this girl come from?? And seeing her through Arin's eyes was a whole nother level of angst I was not prepared for. I felt really invested—not only in the romance—but in Essiya's journey of self discovery. She is TOUGH.And while I have complicated feelings about the ending...that epilogue truly put my heart through the shredder. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

1725609,2025-09-28T18:56:19.621296+00:00,"Summary: A continued exploration of coming to find out that everything you thought you know is wrong.I have been looking forward to reading To Clutch a Razor since this spring when I read the first book of the series. I jumped at a chance to get an advance copy of the audiobook through Netgalley. While I have read Dresden Files and a few other urban fantasy books, this is not really my genre. But the themes of family curses and generational trauma and responsibility for repair are really what draw me to the book.Dymitr is a knight of an old order centered on killing monsters. His family is the center of the leadership of the Polish arm of the order. Dymitr is different because while he has killed and he is highly capable, from a young age he thought that what they were doing was wrong. The last book he attempted to put a stop to his role, but through the work of others, he was given a new task.This is a book that is basically impossible to discuss without spoilers. From here on out, there are spoilers. If you have not read the first book, then stop reading here. This is the link to the post about the first book, which also has marked spoilers. But you need to read that post and book first.When Dymitr became a knight the process splits his soul and his body and his spine becomes a bone sword that he literally has to rip out of his body each time he uses it. It is a painful process but as is discussed more in this book, the Knigth's magic is rooted in pain and it is a perfect symbol of what it means to be a knight. When Baba Jaga agrees to change him to break the curse against his friend Ala, she takes his sword in payment. The sword is the physical manifestation of half of his soul and it creates a longing that, if he can't win it back, will eventually cause him to go mad. Baba Jaga places a series of tasks on him to get the sword back and those tasks start with killing his own grandmother, the head of his order.Ala has taken Dymitr in because he saved her. She has nursed him back to health and given him a place to stay, and along the way she has taught him how to be ""a monster"" since he is no longer human as a result of the magic. But he is also still a knight. There is a real tension between them because as much as Dymitr has shown his desire to change, he did kill her cousin in his past. Her family was cursed because of his grandmother. His work to break the curse against her, as much as it cost him, does not fully overcome the reality that she still suffers memories of the curse.This is a straight forward book and while a bit longer than the first, it still more long novella than full length novel. The main story follows Dymitr and Ala going to his home to try to figure out how to get his bone sword back without killing anyone. Dymitr has changed, not just physically (he is no longer human), but he also sees more about the reality of his family. There is both shame and horror at how he participated in the the mistreatment of others and how much he didn't see before.This is a book that has more violence than I really wanted. That is often present in urban fantasy, but I still don't really want that much violence, even as I liked the book as a whole. There is a romance element to the story. Dymitr and Niko have an attraction. But neither of them is quite willing to give into the attraction. So at this point in the series, there is little more to it than longing and a couple of kisses.Veronica Roth is exploring Polish folk tales in these books. I don't have enough familiarity to know how much is based on older stories and how much is new. These two books are definitely in the adult oriented fantasy and not the YA fantasy bucket. Not the books are inappropriate to older teens, but that the themes are just of interest to people who are older. YA is often coming of age stories of some sort. But this series is more world weary grappling with our own complicity in wrong. There is also light gay romance and very real violence. But that isn't something that would be inappropriate in more YA focused books if the themes were different. Roth is mostly known for her Divergent series and that is more YA. So the reader should not assume that just because she is the author that the books will also be YA.This was originally posted on my blog at https://bookwi.se/to-clutch-a-razor-by-veronica-roth-curse-bearer-2/",To Clutch a Razor,2025-01-28T00:52:55.795853,"A heist.

The writing was great, which is what I expect from her writing.  (That alone I give a 5.0) The descriptions and details were up to par and gave a clear storyline. I have nothing bad to say about the writing and storytelling. I think for me the subject and story as a whole just wasn't for me. The audio production and the narrators were great for this book. I do believe this will be someone's fave book.

We pick up shortly after the events of When Among Crows, following Dymitr as he tries to fulfill a promise to Baba Jaga while visiting his home for the funeral of a family member, Ala as she tries to stop her nightmares, and Niko as he completes a hunt he is assigned.  This book is so cleverly done. The character's each have their own mission, but each mission ends up overlapping on the other. It really asks the questions: “what is family?”, “who in a family matters?”, and “what do you do when you know your family is fundamentally, morally wrong, but you still love them them?” Honestly, this book feels pretty timely. I really don't want to say too much more as the book is very short. Which brings me to my sole complaint: I wish it was longer! It's clear to me that we will get another installment, so I'll just have to wait for book 3.   Also, the cover is clever as well.

2032367,2026-01-07T14:59:48.068493+00:00,"I think this book does a great job of providing an accessible and fairly actionable description of what has gone wrong with the Internet and digital products in general over the last decade or two.There was plenty of stuff that I was expecting, mostly the negatives, but I felt it positively surprised me in a few important ways.First, the book provides a really convincing description of what laws, policies and events have lead to a world where companies can get away with making terrible products.It also contained a surprising amount of optimism. The recent progress in the EU, some glowing feedback for the Biden presidency and Lena Kahn, and the potential for using the recent tariff news cycle to repeal anti-circumvention laws globally.As a tech worker, I went into the book fully expecting to be characterized as part of the problem. It was neat to see this group portrayed as one of the forces pushing against the worsening of digital services. While this leverage is going away, it's great to see it being replaced by such a strong grassroots support for more antitrust work.I feel there were a number of flaws in the presentation. Mostly it would have been nice to have another editing pass. The fact that much of the content was originally published as essays comes out in the repeated explanation (tolerable) and the reused jokes (less so). It could have been nice to have the block of ""case studies"" near the beginning spread out a bit. I feel he uses the ""enshit"" prefix about 30% too often. The description of a ""new good internet"" felt simplistic but maybe that's ok for a general audience. All that said, the important stuff was good, and that's what's important.

The premise is interesting, a viral infection outbreak at an isolated research station in the middle of the desert. While initially you would think the virus takes over each person suddenly, some of the flashback sequences allude that the infection may have occurred gradually. There is also a sense that there may be something wrong with the entire civilization in general, perhaps a pandemic or some other biological crisis, but that part is left fully unexplored.I really wanted to like the novel given the story but there were some core things the author decided to focus on that ultimately left me unsatisfied. The main issue is the erotic obsession of the main character with the virus itself. It seems to take on the central theme, pushing all other important elements aside.

Fortunately, that wasn't really the case. The message of this one felt different, and definitely one worth telling. If this series is unified by one concept it's definitely the feeling of belonging, and whereas b2 felt like it retread the same steps b1 did for the most part, Brigands & Breadknives felt like it had something new to say about it.I think this book is stronger than the second, though it still doesn't really recapture the magic of the first.

I will say the ending felt very solid and I was actually pretty happy with it. The world building was very good, and I wish there had been a bit more of it.Some of the prose felt a little stilted. Other parts felt heartfelt and beautiful. It's hard to quantify any particular areas as being weaker than others, it was just a feeling that cropped up from time to time while reading.I did quite enjoy the evolution of the relationships, and Zyll the goblin was an especially interesting character, but it was hard for me at times to like Fern. Being accused of being 'chronically dissatisfied' felt apt, and I don't entirely feel like that description was ever really fixed. The ending/epilogue tied off some of the emotional loose ends, but I feel like a bit more could have been done to show Fern slowly coming into what it is she truly wanted instead.Not at a bad read at all; not something I'll probably re-read though.",Brigands & Breadknives,2025-01-04T20:19:22.272684,"Fern has weathered the stillness and storms of a bookseller’s life for decades, but now, in the face of crippling ennui, transplants herself to the city of Thune to hang out her shingle beside a long-absent friend’s coffee shop.

Finding out that there's a vacant building next to Legends & Lattes, she sells her old shop and sets off for the big city! She's happy to see Viv and Tandri, but even after she sets up her new shop with the help of handyman Caz, she still feels that emptiness inside. After getting drunk and having a heart to heart with Caz, she finds her self stowing in the way in the back of a wagon. When it transpires that owner of this wagon is the one and only Astryx One-Ear, Blademistress, Oathmaiden, and skilled bounty hunter. Despite some initial misgivings, they begin to travel together and in doing so, Fern finally faces the doubt she has about her future path. This was just as cute as Legends & Lattes and Bookshops & Bonedust, but has a lot more fighting and danger than the other two, making is a little less cosy, but just as sweet and fun.

If I look back at my past preferences, fantasy wasn’t in my wheelhouse at all—yet now, this series feels like a warm blanket on a cold day. A tale of self-discovery and second chances, Brigands and Breadknives by Travis Baldree is a cozy dose of the ""warm fuzzies"" that I desperately needed this January. The story follows Fern, a rattkin who has grown weary of her predictable existence tucked away in a bookstore. Seeking a fresh start, she travels to Thune to visit an old friend—the owner of an inexplicably lucrative coffee shop you might recognize called Legends & Lattes. Fern is hoping for a ""new version"" of herself, but she soon realizes that a change of scenery isn't enough to shake her funk. Restless and overwhelmed, Fern makes the classic mistake of getting ""toasted"" and passing out in an unfamiliar place. This fortuitous error sends her packing far away from Thune with a monster hangover and the company of a strange band of brigands: a feral, hilariously useful goblin and a legendary warrior elf. Together, they fight off dishonorable vagabonds while exploring life’s unexpected opportunities.What truly made me love this book was the brilliant balance of humor and heart. I found myself laughing out loud at Fern’s colorful swearing and the goblin’s antics—and yes, there is even a giant chicken with teeth to keep things interesting! This story is the ultimate ""cozy fantasy"" because while it features real peril and adventure, it maintains a heart of gold. Most importantly, Fern’s journey toward finding her own value outside of life’s demands is so incredibly relatable, especially the parts about getting older and navigating the changing seasons of life. It is a breath of fresh air in the middle of winter, and having read every book in this series, I will definitely read anything Travis Baldree writes next.

Despite this this book was a little different then the others in the way that it is more adventurous than cozy.I enjoyed listening to the book and truly didn’t want it to end. Although I did find there were some boring parts or parts that I had to re-read due to lack of clarity. There is overall a comforting feel to the book despite there being more danger involved. The book focuses on a character from Bookshops & Bonedust that I was happy to see. It’s weird that the book was a little slow considering it had more adventure than the others.

I didn't find it disappointing by any means, but it just wasn't what I expected.But more of that later, first I'm going to go into the characters.DANIELLA COLLINSI hate to say that she was one of the reasons I wasn't overly fond of this book. Compared to Lynn's other FMCs, she didn't feel very “three-dimensional”. In hindsight, she should be: wants to go to Harvard, social anxiety, never felt at home, bullied. She should feel like she's a deep character. But unfortunately, all the things she is were never actually shown to us (other than her social anxiety, and I have things to say about that, too), but rather told to us. We're told she's very bubbly and “happiness personified”, yet we don't see that. Obviously it's because she's changed, and I understand that, but even in scenes where she's shown to be happy, or flashback scenes, she doesn't feel all that sunshine-y to me. She feels sarcastic, yes, but I wouldn't say she's overly outgoing or bubbly.And as for her social anxiety, the way Lynn wrote it annoyed me. As someone who struggles with social anxiety, I didn't necessarily feel that the scenes were inaccurate, but rather too short to fully feel what she was experiencing. I understand this is a romance book, and her social anxiety isn't the main focus, but panic attacks are long-suffering things, and they were cut short.But I do feel disappointed that all these scenes were cut short as when I found out she had social anxiety, I thought that she and I would really connect as I still really struggle with that so I'm slightly peeved over the fact that the scenes where she's panicking are so short.Now, this could he Lynn's editor's fault, so I'm not going to put any blame here, but longer scenes where she's struggling with anxiety is more accurate and I would've enjoyed it more.ALEC BARCZEWSKII really did like him, but unfortunately, he was just lacking that familiar Lynn Painter Book Man feeling. Not in the way that I dislike him, but out of all her YA men, Alec would probably be on the bottom of the list.   Don't get me wrong I think he's so sweet and I love sweet book men, but I was expecting more from him.For example, I saw this thing that I think Lynn posted (I saw it on Pinterest) that said he was addicted to history podcasts. Where is the mention of this in the book? It's implied he read history books, but what about the history podcasts? And on the same thing, it said that he could quote every line of The Sandlot (same with Dani). Where the hell is this scene where he and Dani are sitting together watching The Sandlot while they recite every word, giggling and laughing?   I did love how protective he was over Dani, though. Proper “talk shit about her and I beat you up”. Like, king behaviour right there.OVERALLI guess what I really struggled with in this book was Lynn's writing. I wanted to find more about Dani's bullying and social anxiety. I wanted to see more scenes of Alec and Dani when they were kids. I wanted a scene of Dani and her mom talking about how her mom used to be a genius.Like I've said, maybe she did include these things but her editor told her to remove them (Idk how the publishing world works), but that, overall, I think is the main issue with this book. Also, I wasn't here for the miscommunication trope. Dani easily could've said “Hey, I'm breaking up with you because Benji said that he would file charges otherwise. Still love you, though, honey.” IS THAT SO HARD??Also, I don't know if it's just me, but the writing in this one felt a lot more...sexual (???) than her other YA ones. I understand this is realistic because they're 18-year-olds and hormonal, but one thing I love about Lynn's books is that they're just so cutesy, and the very heated kiss scenes took away from that factor.And so, normally—if it were any other author—I would give this book a three star, but since it's Lynn, I'm gonna give her the benefit of the doubt and add an extra star on there.I think I will give this a re-read, though, in a year or so's time as it might be helpful to read it when I'm a) not sick, and b) I'm not “rushing” through to read it because it's a new release.EDIT: 2 MONTHS LATERI've decided to knock this down half a star. At the start of this year, I decided I wanted to be harsher with my ratings. So, no giving four stars to books that don't actually deserve it. And that means not showing author favouritism. It's hard, because I love Lynn so much, but this book just didn't have that familiar Lynn Painter feel to it, which is disappointing.Over time, though, I have come to think more positively about this book, which is why I'm giving it 3.5 instead of 3. Maybe one day I can grow to love this book, but today just isn't that day.———————————————PRE-READI'm so excited for this book, because, hello, it's a YA Lynn Painter book, but so many new releases have been let-downs for me so I'm afraid that it might be as well.

Dealing with the fallout of her parents’ devastating divorce, Dani wouldn’t mind a nerd-out with the cozy and comforting Alec (and maybe a chance to confront him on his MIA status for all these years). But teenage Alec is nothing like the kid Dani remembers. He’s a hockey star in a town where hockey players are worshiped as gods. Dani’s place as his shadow has been taken up by drooling female fans…and he loves it.

Dani is resolved to ice out her former best friend until an unlikely series of events brings them together—and forces them to fake being a couple. Once forced together, the former childhood sweethearts begin to reconnect, unearth complicated family secrets, and face their true feelings towards each other…including the real reason Alec has been pushing Dani away all these years.",Lynn Painter

When thirty-four-year-old Cath loses her mostly absentee mother, she is ambivalent. With days of quiet, unassuming routine in Buffalo, New York, Cath consciously avoids the impulsive, thrill-seeking lifestyle that her mother once led.

📚 Genre: Contemporary FictionTechnically, it’s tagged as a cozy mystery, but let’s be honest. There’s no actual body here, just a delightfully convincing fake one. That’s why I shelve this under Contemporary Fiction with mystery elements. Welcome to the Murder Week isn’t about solving a murder. It’s about solving a life. This is contemporary fiction wrapped in a clever mystery-shaped bow, and once I let it be that, the book completely had my heart. What Karen Dukess pulls off, though, is the spirit of a cozy without the corpse: a story about belonging, grief, and human connection wrapped in the charm of a pretend whodunit.Karen Dukess balances warmth and ache beautifully. Cath’s grief isn’t loud or dramatic. It’s quiet, unresolved, and shaped by a lifetime of emotional abandonment. The story isn’t just about losing her mother, but about losing the possibility of ever truly being chosen by her. Carlotta Brentan’s narration brings warmth and gentle humor to Cath’s journey, perfect for a book that moves between heartbreak and hilarity.The fake murder week becomes the perfect backdrop: absurd, charming, and gently chaotic. The “corpse” offering sales advice mid-death was delightful, and the villagers fumbling through clue-giving like kids in a school play was genuinely adorable. It’s cozy-adjacent comfort without ever pretending the emotions are small.And then there are the relationships. Wyatt Green and Amity Clark were an unexpected gift. Their protectiveness, both emotional and physical, felt instinctive and pure, especially given how newly formed their bond was. The romance with Dev Sharma adds another layer, not just of attraction, but of possibility. With Dev, Cath isn’t just flirting, she’s confronting whether she deserves to stay, to belong, to choose something instead of running from it. Finding her mother’s origins wasn’t just closure, it was permission. Permission to want more.What really got me was the emotional undercurrent. Cath’s need to understand her mother, to finally feel rooted somewhere. Her relationship with Dev felt genuine, the kind of romance that steadies rather than distracts. And the friendship between Cath, Wyatt, and Amity? Absolute gold. Protective, messy, real, and lasting even in the epilogue of the book. It’s that found-family tenderness that lingers long after the fake murder is solved.Would I recommend it?
Absolutely. This book may not have a real corpse, but it’s full of life, heart, humor, and healing. It’s about chosen family, the wounds parents leave behind, and the quiet bravery it takes to let yourself be loved.",Welcome to Murder Week,2025-02-13T10:24:06.563562,"In this delightfully funny and heartfelt new novel from the author of the “bittersweet page-turner” (The New York Times) The Last Book Party, an American woman travels to the English countryside when she discovers tickets her late mother had purchased for a murder mystery simulation in a small British town.

Well it seems like Hart's skill is in crafting a hook like that, then writing an unsatisfying sequel that hooks you back in at the end with ANOTHER cliffhanger. As such, I probably will (as loath as I am to say it) read the sequel if and when it comes out, but I can't say I'm massively enthralled with the idea of it.

Saeris and Fisher's interactions were delegated to the spice only it seems save for a few encounters.  Their witty banter that had me cackling and craving more from Quicksilver didn't seem to follow in this one.Also, the support characters were woefully absent for most of this book.  I wanted more Renfis, more Lorreth, maybe a concrete update on Layne...and Danya, where the heck was she?!  Carrion of course was on point, but I could have used a bit more of him too. Unfortunately, I started to see the end of this one with all the ""suspense"" building going on in the last 2 chapters so the cliffhanger of this one wasn't nearly as awe-inspiring as Quicksilver.I'll continue the series, because I am invested but I will go begrudgingly into hell for it.",Brimstone,2025-02-01T22:07:51.573129,"Saeris Fane doesn't want power.

1734513,2025-12-10T20:34:54.947152+00:00,"Okay, this is a lot of thoughts. I... don't know where to even begin.First, let me say [Kingfisher] is the /epitome/ of a green flag boyfriend. Because what do you mean, he understands that Saeris is her own person, and should be free to make her own decisions even though he's mated to her? Because most of the mated pairs I've read about at least think they have SOME control over their fated. I love me a supportive MMC, with no question whatsoever that the FMC can handle her own shit.Also, where can I get me my own Carrion Swift? I thought he was great in Quicksilver, but my god do I need a carbon copy of him right now. I don't even need him to be my boyfriend, I just need his company as a friend. The way he supports Saeris the entire time, knowing that he isn't nearly up to the same strength that she is. The way he knows just how to break the tension, in the best way possible. His whole freaking self-discovery was a story on it's own. I feel like I read 3 books in one; The Story of Saeris, The Story of Kingfisher, & The Story of Carrion Swift. Callie really outdid herself with this book. I truly was dropping my jaw at all moments of the book. When I thought characters were going to turn on us, when I thought characters would die, when I thought characters would be stuck apart or left behind. Ugh, the ups and downs kept me reeling. Towards the middle end, after Saeris had the book from Edina for a while and started to 'magically' figure things out, it got a little tropey. But it wasn't so bad that it deterred me from continuing. Honestly, the idea of Edina leading Saeris from the past is so well written. Edina knows that Saeris is going to want to open the book and read ahead. But she also knows that despite her undying curiosity, she's not going to risk the lives of those she holds dear and take the risks. It just feels like Saeris randomly knowing things without it being in the book is a little TOO reaching. Finally having a different name to call Fisher though, ugh my heart is so happy. While I love the idea of his name origins, and that the Fae cannot reveal their true names, it just fits him so much better. And his nickname she immediately gives him? UGH my heart 💙. But I was NOT expecting the fact that he was a half-god?! Like...okay, that didn't show anywhere to me!I figured that brimstone would have to come from dragons, being that the only other source they could get it from was the fire sprites. What else lives off the heat that they need to survive, but also replenishes it's own source? Dragons! I don't forgive Callie for Onyx though. Not even a little. Bringing him back does not relieve me of the trauma of losing him 😭.All in all, I truly loved this book. It was a gift that kept on giving. I loved the arc spent with Fisher & Carrion, them becoming more allies than enemies. I loved learning about the friends that Saeris was beginning to have, and their own paths. I loved seeing her come into her powers more, and start to feel like she ACTUALLY belongs there. This book was dense. I genuinely felt like I read 3 different books in the span of a week. (Not that that's not uncommon, but still.) I kept expecting the book to end, only for it to continue. There were many places that Callie could have ended it, driving us crazy with suspense. Where it did end though, was perfect. It was enough of a cliffhanger to make you scream ""WTF"", but also didn't leave us in complete limbo; we knew that our favorites were alive, we knew that Onyx was not dead, everyone was accounted for, and we weren't left wondering about too many things. The whole thing with Everlayne is still up in the air, but we know that she is at least alive and within a safe place. We know what happened to Tal, Zovena, and Renfis. We know that Hayden is struggling, but he's alive and protected for the time being. She could have ended it so much worse, but she gave us the peace of knowing that the only uncertainty lay with our two MCs.Bravo, Callie. Truly. I cannot wait for the 3rd and (I believe) final book in the series. I can't wait to see where she takes our favorites, and how this story ends. Everything leads to Saeris dying; but will she truly, or will someone else maybe take her place? Hayden, perhaps? 👀",Brimstone,2025-02-01T22:07:51.573129,"Saeris Fane doesn't want power.

1734513,2025-12-24T09:49:58.528469+00:00,Starts off quite slow. I got to about 40% of the way through and was actually getting a bit fed up by how slow it was and considered giving up on the book entirely. But then it got interesting and stayed that way right till end. I wonder sometimes if authors deliberately use so much filler stuff in a sequel so they can make it into a trilogy. But I'd much prefer a shorter second book so there can be a third than suffer through a bunch of boring filler material to meet a page count. Most of the first half of this book could have been cut without losing anything of merit or changing the story at all.,Brimstone,2025-02-01T22:07:51.573129,"Saeris Fane doesn't want power.

Also, the information in this book was very convoluted. I was having to fact check what was in Quicksilver to determine if the characters were referencing information I should know about, or if it was new information that the POV characters knew about, but I as a reader hadn't received the reveal yet. Plot lines were started in this book, but just kind of dwindled off unresolved, or were just magically handwaved at the end. Callie basically just got the plot to the cliffhanger she wanted to leave it on, and stopped the book there. The series feels like one giant book chopped up at random cliffhangers at this point.I'll still read the next book, but at this point the series has fallen down on my priority list, unforch.",Brimstone,2025-02-01T22:07:51.573129,"Saeris Fane doesn't want power.

1905977,2025-06-23T14:31:07.052197+00:00,"Strange House by Uketsu opens with a compelling setup: a writer interested in the occult is invited by a friend—an architect named Kurihara—to investigate a strangely constructed home in Tokyo. The house is full of oddities: dead space, unnerving layouts, and a past that refuses to stay buried. As they explore its design and history, they encounter unsettling documents, cryptic floorplans, and a widow whose story deepens the mystery.The novel’s strength lies in its atmosphere. The writing is eerie and disorienting by design, and the shifting timelines and layered perspectives create a sense of constant unease. It kept my interest throughout, especially during my long commutes—there’s something deeply engaging about the way the story slowly reveals itself, piece by piece.Where it fell short for me was in the resolution. While the buildup is intriguing and the premise original, some of the final turns didn’t deliver the impact I was hoping for. The novel leans heavily into ambiguity, and though that will appeal to some readers, I found certain plot threads less satisfying than expected.Still, Strange House is a distinctive and original work of psychological horror. Readers who appreciate open-ended narratives, experimental structure, and stories that blur the line between memory and reality will likely find it rewarding.Many thanks to Pushkin Press and NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review.",Strange Houses,2025-06-05T02:53:35.414313,"From the bestselling author of the wildly inventive Strange Pictures and a phenomenon in Japan—unnatural layouts, trap doors, windowless rooms— a sinister conspiracy is concealed within a house’s warped and unsettling floor plans

Once I saw the first layout (not a spoiler - the book title has plurality), I realised I had seen it from somewhere else already. Perhaps Uketsu themselves, or TikTok, or Instagram - some other media. Anyway, I had forgotten what I gained from seeing it the first time, so it wasn't much of a spoiler for me and rather spurred me on to find out (or remember) what was so strange about it.I had no idea what I was in for. The story takes you way further than just peculiar blueprints. It takes you to (in Uketsu fashion) a world smaller than you'd like to admit, to family secrets, to whodunnit-style sleuthing, to shock and horror. One wouldn't be wrong in thinking that the entire situation was simply too complex and extreme to be realistic, but humans are capable of more than you would like to admit.At some point, I was hit with a barrage of information on how things came to be. I got lost in the sheer amount of names, their relation to each other, but I think I got there in the end. I'm sure if I go back and re-read it, perhaps with a pen and paper, I could get my head around the intricacies of the plot. Perhaps I will, in the future.For now, I liked what I read, and I look forward to the next translated book.",Strange Houses,2025-06-05T02:53:35.414313,"From the bestselling author of the wildly inventive Strange Pictures and a phenomenon in Japan—unnatural layouts, trap doors, windowless rooms— a sinister conspiracy is concealed within a house’s warped and unsettling floor plans

1905977,2025-09-07T21:32:24.450855+00:00,"I absolutely loved Uketsu's Strange Pictures and perhaps my mistake was to read that one first because this book, Strange Houses, feels not as well-constructed as the other one.If you're familiar with the very popular Strange Pictures, a comparison with this one is inevitable. The main concept remains the same: using house floor plans instead of drawings to narrate an eerie and convoluted story about some mystery that gets resolved in the end. However, the way the pieces of the puzzle connect in this book is oftentimes too far fetched to make it believable.We go from “This enpty space in the house feels odd” to “This is a murder house” in zero time, depriving the reader (in this case me. Hi, I'm reader) of details that could help them understand or find their own conclusions like it happens in the other book. At some point in the story, towards the end to be precise, a series of random characters get introduced in very few words to simply justify the convoluted and confusing story behind the strange houses. I literally lost track of who was who at some point and all I know is that there's an open ending that doesn't leave me satisfied.Still a cute quick read, but read it before starting Strange Pictures.

1905977,2025-11-08T19:24:31.067069+00:00,"I really, really wanted to like this book. The idea behind it — let's look at some room layouts that look normal but, on closer inspection, are just a little off — as a kick-off point for the book is a unique and fun idea. And it could be VERY creepy, depending on how it's done. However, this book has some big issues, in my opinion. ***** Spoilers Below ******One of the first things that struck me was the crazy and, frankly, entirely unbelievable way the first two characters (the architect and the author) magically piece together what the house is being used for. Where ON EARTH did they get murderous children from that blueprint? Secret passage, sure, I can buy that. But to jump to a full-blown murderous child plan was bizarre. More bizarre that it was right. Crazy. I could not move past this ridiculous correct first “guess”. Another thing that I found was that the dialog was stiff and uncomfortable. This I am willing to chock up to having something to do with the translation, perhaps, since this was originally written in Japanese and then translated to English after the fact, if I'm not mistaken. Of course other cultures have different social speaking habits and such which is entirely expected, but this dialog seemed to go beyond that into a stiff, nearly robotic at times, cadence. They say you should show and not tell. Naturally, that's not a rule, but simply something to keep in mind as you write. There are times when telling instead of showing is the best route. However, this book was ENTIRELY telling, with VERY little — if any — showing. The book read like an exposition dump. I understand we were supposed to be reading an article or something of the sort, but every single piece of dialog was an exposition dump. You know those videos games that you go around and end up finding log files/notes/diary pages and such in that serve as exposition dumps? I truly feel those often have far more “showing” than this book did. Again, I really, really wanted to love this. I had such high hopes. The concept: pretty good. The execution: needs some work.",Strange Houses,2025-06-05T02:53:35.414313,"From the bestselling author of the wildly inventive Strange Pictures and a phenomenon in Japan—unnatural layouts, trap doors, windowless rooms— a sinister conspiracy is concealed within a house’s warped and unsettling floor plans

We get a lot of information quickly:  lots of letters and long speeches!

The current book is more straightforward and less convoluted than the predecessor, which in my opinion slightly reduces its charm. It feels more like a typical horror story. Perhaps one of the intriguing aspects is the conclusion reached before sufficient evidence is presented, which ultimately turns out to be correct by the end of the book, albeit with more details.

The daughter of a Taiwanese father and white mother, Vi Liu has never quite fit into her Midwestern college town. Aimless after getting dumped by her boyfriend and dropping out of college, Vi works at the front desk of a hotel where she greets guests, refills cucumber water samovars, and tries to evade her bubbly blond coworker, Rachel. Little does Vi know her life is about to be permanently transformed when she agrees to a night out with Rachel. In the alley outside the bar, Vi discovers a strange blob—a small living creature with beady black eyes. In a moment of concern and drunken desperation, she takes it home.

But the blob is no ordinary pet. Becoming increasingly sentient, it begins to grow, shift shape, and obey Vi’s commands. As the entity continues to change, Vi is struck with a daring idea: she’ll mold the creature into her ideal partner.

As a debut novel, it showcases an ambitious vision, but I found the plot challenging to follow. The intricate narrative and the imaginative stretch required to dive into its fantastical world didn’t quite click for me, as someone less familiar with the sci-fi fantasy genre. Fans of complex, genre-driven stories may find this debut captivating, but it wasn’t my cup of tea. Perfect for avid sci-fi fantasy readers exploring new authors, but it may not suit everyone.As I chose this as a part of challenge, and ended up not following the book because it wasn't my genre, I choose not to rate the book.

Every single one of them had something that they were dealing with. And when shit hit the fan, they had to make emotionally tough decisions based on their individual circumstances. Because the author gives us a great foundation, readers also become invested. Very well done.This is more than a book about slavery and vampires. It is about people who seized an opportunity for revenge. You know this book is saying something when vampires aren’t the worst monsters around.This is a historical fiction horror that takes you to the 1700s. Markus Redmond doesn’t hold back. We get a peek at some horrors many of our ancestors had to endure. It’s raw, so check your triggers.This is the vampire book I didn’t know I needed. I spent half of the year bragging about “The Buffalo Hunter Hunter” by Stephen Graham Jones (which was a great read also), but this one is slightly better. And included Native Americans. It receives a perfect score.I buddy read this with my wife. We both loved it and couldn’t put it down. I put this book in the same category as Ring shout (P.

What if nobody ever freed the slaves…because they freed themselves – 150 years before the Civil War?

In the Province of Carolina, 1710, freedom seems unattainable for Willie, for his beloved Gertie, and for their unborn child. They live, suffer, and toil under their brutal master, James “Big Jim” Barrow, whose grand plantation was built by the blood, sweat, and tears of the enslaved. To flee this hell on earth is be hunted and killed. Until one strange night Willie is offered a dark hope by Rafazi, an enigmatic slave with an irresistible and blood-chilling path to liberation.

Hailing from the Kingdom of Ghana, Rafazi is the lone survivor of the Ramanga, an African vampire tribe rendered nearly extinct by plague. Rafazi has roamed the world for centuries with an undying desire to replenish the power that once defined his heritage. In Willie, Rafazi has found his first biddable subject to be turned and to help in a hungry revolt. And Willie desires nothing more than to free his people from malicious bondage. Whatever it takes.

One by one, as an army of blood slaves thirsting for revenge is gathered, the headstrong Gertie fears that no good can come from the vampiric legacy that courses through Rafazi’s veins. Willie knows that only evil can fight evil. And when the woman he loves stands between the reemergence of the Ramanga and the justified slaughter of the oppressors, Willie must make an irreversible decision. Only one thing is certain: on the Barrow plantation, and beyond, blood will spill.

I was excited after hearing this was the book to read after watching Sinners, but this shocked me /neg. Very little time was spent on the history of the vampires. The prologue included a singular scene focusing on the history and that was it. A very large majority of this book was inflicting pain on the slaves, especially the women and children. There needs to be content warnings because I was not expecting to read multiple graphic rape and torture scenes. None of the violent scenes contributed to the plot or character development, in my opinion. The revenge scene was lackluster and too short. The native rep was lazy, and I wish the women had been listened to throughout the story as they warned the men (including our main character) of the hubris of listening to the vampire. The writing style was fantastic, don't get me wrong, and the story was well paced and compelling, in an odd sort of way; however, I think the plot was too focused on torturing the slaves and looking down on them (there's a scene where it's insinuated that the vampires become enlightened and that's why they no longer speak like slaves) instead of the interesting vampire lore or the freedom of the slaves.

The characters felt heartbreakingly real, and my heart aches for Duane.Julia has endured far too much for someone just 13 years old. After losing her entire family, she's raised by her aunt and uncle—but when tragedy strikes again, she becomes consumed by vengeance. How far will she go to settle the score? And how far will Duane go to protect her in her relentless quest? You wouldn't believe me if I told you.This book is brilliantly crafted. The prose felt unconventional at first, but by the third chapter, it hit its stride, and suddenly, it was full throttle to the end. By the time the extreme gore kicked in, I was absolutely ravenous for more vampire havoc.

Things aren’t easy, but Minor is scraping by.

Then a vampire walks into his bar and ruins his life.

When Minor crosses John Varley, a killer who sleeps during the day beneath loose drifts of earth and grows teeth in the light of the moon, Varley brutally retaliates by murdering Heidi, leaving Minor broken with guilt and Julia filled with rage. What’s left of their splintered family is united by only one desire: vengeance.

So begins a furious, frenzied pursuit across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. From grimy alleyways to desolate highways to snow-lashed plains, Minor and Julia are cast into the dark orbit of undead children, silver bullet casters, and the bevy of broken men transfixed by Varley’s ferocity.

When Minor crosses John Varley, a killer who sleeps during the day beneath loose drifts of earth and grows teeth in the light of the moon, Varley brutally retaliates by murdering Heidi, leaving Minor broken with guilt and Julia filled with rage. What’s left of their splintered family is united by only one desire: vengeance.

So begins a furious, frenzied pursuit across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. From grimy alleyways to desolate highways to snow-lashed plains, Minor and Julia are cast into the dark orbit of undead children, silver bullet casters, and the bevy of broken men transfixed by Varley’s ferocity. Everyone’s out for blood.

Gritty, unforgettable, and emotionally devastating, Coffin Moon asks what will be left of our humanity when grief transmutes into violence, when monsters wear human faces, and when our thirst for revenge eclipses everything else.",Keith Rosson

The main female character acts like a naive child who has to be told what to do every second of every day, despite being 34 years old and somehow the CEO of her own PR company. She's scared of her own shadow, and yet she's in charge? Please.Her backstory is murky and I don't understand any of it. So she got placed with her foster family at age 10, but somehow her bio dad is married to her foster mother? Where was he when she was placed with her? Does she even share blood with any of her siblings? They have another bio dad, but FMC's bio dad and the foster mother are married.... And her foster mother had a child a year after FMC was placed there. Who's the father? What is her father doing there in this foster/adoptive home? Where was he when she placed him there? She has a bio-grandfather who was mentioned once. But why did she have to be placed in a foster family in the first place? No idea. If this is explained later, great, but I'm not sticking around to find out.The writing is dense, it slows down the plot, and I can barely get through it. We're in the middle of the scene, and someone asks her a question, and instead of answering or moving the scene along, she starts to describe the room they're in with every little detail. Or there's a surprise flashback that has nothing to do with the scene, and when we get back to the present, I already forget what was happening in the present.

The Pyro (Roland) is a supernatural being and free agent, neither villain nor hero at the beginning of the story (but leaning towards villain in the public eye). He works with Vanessa's firm to rebrand himself as a hero. As shy Vanessa and grouchy Roland get to know one another professionally, the line between work life and personal life blurs dramatically, especially as forces out of their control conspire to threaten their world. This was such a great premise! I thought the superhero/civilian tension worked well. And Roland and Vanessa work very well together as a couple (but I also really liked them both individually). Roland and Vanessa's initial meet-cute gone bad masks strong feelings between two individuals who both think themselves incapable of love and of being loved. Vanessa and Roland were endearing as each learned to let down their guard; I felt for Vanessa with her past. Dual POVs. Open-door romance (the “good girl” variety, which I found a little off-putting at times but it's there if you're into that), very insta-love (but because he's a sexy alien you roll with it), with a very fated-mates feel. Great supporting characters, Vanessa's family was fantastic and very believable as her dedicated support system, as was her employee and best friend Margerie. I wish Roland had more social support of his own, but then I guess he has Vanessa and her family/friends for that. This is a new-to-me author, I would definitely read her again! With the mystery of who the Forty-Eight really are and where they came from (and why they came to Earth in the first place), there's a lot of leeway for the author to get creative, which she did. This kind of sci-fi is perfect for me, there's minimal world-building to follow since it's really just an alt-universe Earth that has supernatural superheroes and villains. (It also helps that they all seem to be ridiculously stunning.) Do pay attention to content warnings, as there are some heavier themes that the author handles with care. Written with wit, this was a lot of fun to read, and there was an HEA for Roland and Vanessa that satisfied my mushy side. This book made me want to abandon all responsibilities and read all day instead. And it feels like the start of a series, so I really hope there's a next installment!

This is an isolation that she has enforced on herself without telling anyone close to her why - certainly not her sister Misery or her mate. When an attack means she's not safe to stay alone, she gets forced into close proximity with Cohen, the tall, dark, and moody alpha of the North West pack, and finds that lying about her situation just won't work any more. I enjoyed this just as much as I did Bride and it was lovely to see more of Misery, Lowe, and particularly the adorable Ana. Cohen is a firm and stoic alpha, the perfect foil to Serena's sarcasm (derived from all her years with Misery) and seeing them circle around each other was very entertaining. The way the pack dynamics, cult conspiracy theories, and the mysteries of Serena's past are all wrapped up together was intriguing and I hope we get to see more of these characters one day!

1785259,2025-10-29T11:01:59.724278+00:00,"I have no clue how this novel gets so much praise. I enjoyed reading it, but mostly for the wrong reasons.Hints on later plot points aheadFirst of all, I really liked the writing style. The dialogues feel natural, the book is easy to read and easy to follow.The main character Serena is a silly bean with a lot of self-irony that she developed as trauma coping. And i love that. It is one of the best trauma handling I've ever seen in a character, and I think a lot of people can relate to that.However, her role in the entire plot is somewhere between ""my first dom/sub fantasy"" and outright misogynistic tradwife shit. The difference between those two are for me that in a kink fantasy, the power dynamic either is approached with consent, or completely unhinged from the beginning (non-consent trope). In Mate, however, Serena quietly assumes her position as a damsel and household wife, whose main role is to make food for the Alpha's ""Seconds"" (vibes of your husband has the boys over for a football game). I haven't read any of Ali Hazelwood's other books and did not read up on her, but - just from reading Mate - it does remind me a lot of the ""christian"" fundamentalist view of women portrayed in the Twilight series. It is a thing that I accept while enjoying the parts of a work that I like, but prevents me from being able to recommend the books to anyone else.Speaking of her role in the plot - it feels like the entire plot is just there to justify the slow-burn, followed by 100 pages of sex. Don't get me wrong: Those 100 pages of sex were very fun to read. But you will be disappointed if you expect any of the plot lines to be resolved in any satisfactory manner. A lot of things are brushed off at the end in a few pages at most. Two of the bigger mysteries are just opened up so you can have the protagonist damseled repeatedly, and closed off with ""yea… that is taken care of.""And oh my fuck, the main twist is beyond stupid and inconsequential (how did literally no one think of that for months?).Every chapter in Mate just establishes things that eventually lead to either nothing or sex. I've read a few other kinky dark romance novels before, and this one should've been right up my alley. But this is a mild kink portrayal, a boring conservative romance, and an unrewarding novel. I had my fun reading this, and there was a lot of potential, but the read was just frustrating.",Mate,2025-02-24T20:13:38.41399,"Serena Paris is orphaned, pack-less, and one of a kind.

En la línea de Novia, en este libro podemos ver un omegaverse entretenido al que le han eliminado todo lo asquerosamente misógino, aunque su propia concepción en sí ya lo sea. Lo bueno de Hazelwood, y en lo único que creo que no puede fallar, es en darnos hombres que saben cuidar, que se interesan y que saben lo que es el consentimiento, vamos, personas normales y de las que faltan en mundos paranormales regidos por estas reglas.Este libro lo tiene todo, escenas spicy interesantes, personajes divertidos y, en este caso, una trama continua de la que me apetece mucho seguir leyendo.",Mate,2025-02-24T20:13:38.41399,"Serena Paris is orphaned, pack-less, and one of a kind.

1785259,2025-12-21T14:56:57.497569+00:00,"Mate is the sequel to Ali Hazlewood's Bride. It follows Misery's friend, Serena, as she continues to discover what it means to be a half-Ware.   Do you have to read Bride to read this? Normally for interconnected romances I would say no, but in this case yes. Let's be honest, Hazlewood is not a fantasy (or paranormal) writer typically. The world building in Bride was surface level, and there's not a ton more world building in this story, but for anything to make sense you kind of need to have a basis for this world.   On the surface, this book is...okay? If you're looking for a masterpiece, this isn't it. However, if you're looking for a funny, self-aware, AO3-esque experience that will take you back to being 13 again, this is it.   From a character perspective, I actually really like Serena. She's a good character. Relatable enough and a little silly and extremely naïve. Her not understand how things work makes total sense.   What doesn't make any sense is the doctors around her not knowing what's happening. Yes, I understand she's a “new species” but like, I knew what was happening from page one, so they need to catch up.   Koen in....Koen. He's a man who is obsessed with his girl (positive) but says stupid things like “jizzmuffin” (negative). Also, the rules around his pack make sense only if you don't think about them, but again, I don't think anyone is picking up a Ali Hazlewood expecting a fully logical paranormal world, so whatever.   It was fun. I liked it. I probably won't think about it often, but if she writes another in this world I'll read it. ",Mate,2025-02-24T20:13:38.41399,"Serena Paris is orphaned, pack-less, and one of a kind.

I binge read the entire novel.I honestly wanted to find romance novel like this for quite some time but I don't mean it in this genre perse but more about how it energises me so much.But that's all about me so what I actually wanted to say was about Ali Hazelwood's writing style. it's unique though I wouldn't maybe not call it revolutionary but I still feel like something she has crafted on her own.The novel being fully on fl's perspective BUT getting snippets of the ml's perspective at the beginning of the chapters were everything to me.This little detail and how the story actually started... with being to plot wisely so structurally articulated, I think these all little details should be studied.And I'm not even kidding.So only the people who read it can actually understand what I mean by structurally beautiful. Still, I'll try to explain a bit so spoilers ahead.It started when she was small and a closet when her mother dies and a person find her. Next we hear about her mass murdering. So I assumed she killed the person because even if he seemed good to children he did kill her mom. (and I have read Bride so long ago that I don't remember if there's something I missed here) So, when later it is revealed that HE was the one there (and what i liked was that it wasn't revealed the way I wrote. Neither of them remember meeting each other and for all I know I'm reading more into it. But ofc they met then. They do know he's the one he gave her to the system but not exactly the meeting point.All in all, I cannot find a point to critisize in this book. I also liked how her secrets were revealed and not held from us stubbornly to keep our curiosity and then become disappointed in the big reveal. The Book just felt so smooth and natural. Revealing everything just at the right time. To be honest I love the plot I'm-going-to-die-and-have-accepted-but-turns out-I'm-wrong and here it was executed very nicely.So really, what CAN I say? I did not want to give this more than 4 stars ✨️  but I have to have 1 single critism at the every least to decrease. Thing is just that the tropes and all are not very revolutionary and I thought it was only all about my vibes.

There really was only one chapter that focused on the suspense part, so hesitant to even call it that at all. Grant was generally unproblematic. Said all the right things. Was the right kind of flirty with a smirk, and a take what he wants kind of guy. Laney came into town to keep herself safe. Kind of like WITSEC but not officially. The connection between her handler and the Foxx family was an odd surprise. Laney was the classic cool girl, took no shit, but still a girls girl.

I loved all of the characters, from Laney, the FMC and Grant Foxx, the MMC to the entire Foxx family and the quirky townspeople. Laney & Grant were drawn to each other from first sight. Although Grant did his best to fight it. He turned out to be an adorable golden retriever with a deliciously dirty mouth. Laney was bold and not afraid to tell Grant exactly what she thought. I loved the development of their relationship and the story.  I also loved that there wasn't unnecessary relationship drama. Connor Crais and Samantha Brentmoor were incredible. Their narration of the audiobook was captivating and enticing. The character's emotions were palpable. Their chemistry was off the charts. I devoured the audiobook.

It was a bit of a slow start for me but then it just lived up to its name...like a good Bourbon the more I read, the more I loved!!! I enjoyed the suspense storyline, the strong FMC, and Grant...don't even go there! That man was so damn fine!!I loved Laney! If I were a book character, I would be her, hands down! She was strong, lived in the now and didn't need a man to save her. She was badass, beautiful and just oozed confidence and love. She was so much fun and if she was in the real world, I would circle her orbit.Grannntttt!!! OMG, if you ever wanted to meet a cowboy that wasn't a cowboy, it's Grant! Broody, grumpy, hot AF with his jeans, t-shirts and that blue ball cap...melt.me.into.a.puddle!! He was so misunderstood and I loved Laney for him. I loved his story and how he grew within himself in this book.These two characters were like fire! The sexual tension phenomenally oozed off the pages. Grant was a filthy talker and Laney just lapped.it.up! I loved their time together, their dynamics and just the whole storyline. They were so perfect, I'm so glad they found each other. Shared POV, you get to meet the entire Foxx family and I loved them! More books to come in this series and I can't wait to read them all. Shared POV and ends in a beautiful and steamy HEA.Having read all of Victoria's books, she is becoming quite the unicorn in this field.

However I'm very glad I did, it really was a great story. So why not 5 stars? I HATE A LOVE TRIANGLE. Like with a passion. I've always hated them and always probably will. So considering that's a cornerstone of the book, you know it has to be great to be such a high rating. I stayed a bit unsure of the book in the middle. I did not love Beth, she made very immature decisions though she is really young with a lot of trauma. I didn't love Gabriel either, he was too entitled. Frank was too good for this world in general. However in the end it all made sense. The twists were some of the most shocking I've seen. I didn't see an ounce of it coming. I audibly gasped. So whether you hate love triangles like me or it's out of your genre, I say read this regardless. It is worth the journey and such a beautiful book!",Broken Country,2025-03-27T22:58:44.758617,"A love triangle unearths dangerous, deadly secrets from the past in this thrilling tale perfect for fans of The Paper Palace and Where the Crawdads Sing.

“The farmer is dead. He is dead, and all anyone wants to know is who killed him.”

Beth and her gentle, kind husband Frank are happily married, but their relationship relies on the past staying buried. But when Beth’s brother-in-law shoots a dog going after their sheep, Beth doesn’t realize that the gunshot will alter the course of their lives. For the dog belonged to none other than Gabriel Wolfe, the man Beth loved as a teenager—the man who broke her heart years ago. Gabriel has returned to the village with his young son Leo, a boy who reminds Beth very much of her own son, who died in a tragic accident.

As Beth is pulled back into Gabriel’s life, tensions around the village rise and dangerous secrets and jealousies from the past resurface, this time with deadly consequences. Beth is forced to make a choice between the woman she once was, and the woman she has become.

1821295,2026-01-12T00:54:18.693439+00:00,"I loved this book! I became fully immersed in the story, almost feeling as if it was me who was stuck in each impossible situation that was presented. There were so many layers of heartbreak, but for me the biggest heartbreak of all was meeting Beth as a bright, ambitious young woman with a love of literature only to finish the story with her almost resigned to being “just a farmer’s wife”. In my mind, Beth and Gabriel were the better couple. He saw and shared Beth’s ambition and pushed her towards it. Sure they had problems, but they were only teenagers and I don’t think they got to love each other as maturely as they could have since they ended so quickly. I do think Beth loved Frank, but I think it was a love born out of convenience where she found love and happiness in a life that was a consolation prize for the life she felt like she couldn’t have. I found it absolutely heartbreaking to read about a love so physically, emotionally, and intellectually passionate only to have them not end up together.",Broken Country,2025-03-27T22:58:44.758617,"A love triangle unearths dangerous, deadly secrets from the past in this thrilling tale perfect for fans of The Paper Palace and Where the Crawdads Sing.

1864204,2025-11-19T08:59:09.750449+00:00,"4⭐️ - A sweet and steamy story of stolen moments and a small-home school bus!Lane is about as commitment averse as it's possible to be, her past family traumas and loss making falling for somebody seem like a path to pain. Therefore, despite the obvious attraction, the report they have, and one very good New Years kid, she keeps her friend Matt at arms length. That is, until she buys a school bus on a whim to turn into a travelling tiny home - because Matt is the only person she knows with the commercial licence required to drive the thing. Cue a long road trip to collect the thing and many hours working in close proximity to make it liveable. With all that time in small spaces together, it becomes harder and harder to resist what's right there. This is the second book in Hannah's 'Next' series, following on as a direct sequel to Next of Kin, and it was so lovely to see Chloe, Warren, Willow, and Em again. The main focus is on Lane and Matt though - the former Chloe's old college roommate and friend, the latter Warren's co-owner and colleague at their auto shop. Lane's commitment-phobia (as well as her at times debilitating agoraphobia) are at odds with Matt's large family and clear desire to make a life with somebody and it was so lovely following their story. It's such a good romance and very relatable, super worth a read, especially if you've read Next of Kin. One sad thing is that it states, at the end of the book, that the next entry in the series would be out in 2023.. this clearly never happened. It was due to be Warren's brother Luke's story with Matt's sister Tabitha - I'd have adored reading that.

The book drags in spots, spending too much time on subjects that didn't hold my interest. I found myself wishing someone had trimmed about a hundred pages.The Google focus surprised me. I understand why you can't tell the OpenAI story without discussing the competition, but this felt like overkill for a book supposedly about Altman's company. Still, working in tech myself, I appreciated getting the inside view of how these organizations actually operate. Those sections worked for me because they revealed the kind of details you don't usually get from press releases and sanitized corporate narratives.What stayed with me most was the attention paid to the people who actually build these AI systems - the data labelers and content moderators working in difficult conditions around the world.

El inicio me pareció increíble, un buen enemies to lovers con personajes muy chulos y lejos de roles de géneros estúpidos, pesados y cargantes. El problema es que de tan buenos, al final la chicha se queda en... nada. La tensión es casi inexistente, no hay avance entre ellos que se sienta genuino, que se sienta electrizante y vivo como ocurre con las primeras etapas de la atracción. Al revés, parecen un matrimonio que llevan ya sus Bodas de Oro a la espalda. No consigo creermelos demasiado como interés romántico y creo que funcionan casi que mejor como amigos. Muy buenos amigos, pero poco más allá de ello.Todo el apartado romántico es bonito, es lo que tiene cuando, además, haces un personaje masculino en condiciones: comprensivo, atento, con sus fallos pero con capacidad para reparar en ellos y, lo que para mí es más importante, un hombre dispuesto a mostrar sus debilidades y abrirse a los demás. Creo que genuinamente es el típico tío que toda persona querría es su vida, en cualquier tipo de relación. En cuanto a los conflictos que hay, creo que existe bastante poca emoción y desarrollo en ellos. Es un punto a favor que no se describan cosas innecesarias, pero en este caso a veces se pasa de poco descriptivo, de desarrollar poco tanto el conflicto en sí, como el proceso para superarlo y sus debates internos.Por otra parte, me gusta que en general ninguno de los protagonistas se describa en demasia, dejándote a ti espacio a imaginar, y que por esto mismo no estén metidos dentro del mismo canon de mujeres pequeñitas y delgadas y tíos altos y mazados.En términos generales bien, pero creo que sobre todo si se busca una lectura muy amena, con un amor muy tranquilo y con apenas altibajos.",An Academic Affair,2025-07-06T13:06:23.736353,"Sadie Shaw and Jonah Fisher have been academic rivals since they first crossed paths as undergraduates in the literature department thirteen years ago.

Sadie and Jonah have a complex relationship with a long-standing academic rivalry, resulting in a fake marriage for employment purposes. I mean, what's not to love here? Funny dialogue and internal observations, heartfelt pining with a slow burn to a “happy for now” ending, enemies-to-lovers vibes, and cut-throat academia. This is definitely a character-driven book, although there's plenty of plot to keep things moving in this rivals-with-depth romance. I loved how Sadie and Jonah related to each other, even when they were at odds. The yearning levels were enjoyably high, and there was a decent pay-off to all that yearning. I'm not always a fan of the fake relationship trope but it was done really well here, aided by their long-standing relationship, the well-developed main characters, and the alternating 1st-person POVs. (The only thing I didn't really enjoy were the footnotes, which thankfully became enjoyable and less intrusive once you got used to them. Also a plus is that they were only in Jonah's sections.) Every so often I find an author who's just so good with a delightful turn of phrase, seemingly randomly inserted here and there in the story. It takes me by surprise and it adds so many layers of enjoyment to the reading experience. I can't fully explain it, except that it adds depth to the characters and it makes them seem that much more interesting and relatable. It makes me want to see how the story unfolds in a way that I don't always experience, and I'm always happy when I come across an author who writes like that.

When he learned that she was in love with her brother's best friend, he leaped at the chance to fake a relationship and teach her a few tricks to make him jealous.Skylar didn't want anything to do with a womanizer from a hockey team, but after losing a bet, she began to see a different side of him. With her family's annual competition looming close and her needing a partner, she agreed to fake a relationship with Robbie, hoping someone else might notice her. And when she so desperately needed to learn how to flirt and please a man - and who better to teach her than the guy who had no trouble with women?So what, that Robbie was a giant who kissed like she was the last bit of water in the desert, and he was dying for more. So what that his touch was possessive, and with each new lesson, her walls crumbled down more and more until nothing was left? She couldn't possibly love Robbie, right?I have to admit: I didn't care about Robbie in the previous books. I disliked his 'orgasm donor' persona and I was glad that he decided to change his behaviour in this book; he became a much more sympathetic character. I love me a man who worships the ground his woman walks upon. Skylar was a firecracker who put Robbie in his place again and again and he begged for more. I love a pathetic man who can't exist without a woman he loves, while she couldn't be less bothered.The relationship between them was very fast-paced - it was only a week, after all, but somehow, it made it believable. I usually dislike insta-love, but Tessa has surprised me again, and I loved it in this book. I believed that they loved each other and wanted to move in so fast. I loved how protective Robbie was over Sky and how he read her family a riot act about their behaviour.The spice was so hot I had to fan myself, and was this, perhaps, the first book without butt stuff?

He’s made it to the NHL, his best friend/teammate and fellow “orgasm donor” is his roomie—and the women of Boston love them both. Life is sweet. 

That is, until he meets Skylar Paige, division 1 softball pitcher, girl least likely to take anyone’s bull…and the one member of the opposite sex immune to his charms. Robbie might be dazzled by the badass pitcher, but Skylar pegs him as a filthy player and wants nothing to do with him.

When he discovers she’s carrying a serious torch for her brother’s best friend, Robbie knows he should just go back to clubbing and whipped cream bikini parties, but he can’t seem to leave Skylar to flounder on her romantic quest to land another man. Nor can he miss out on the opportunity to spend time with her and hopefully redeem himself. 

Before Robbie knows it, he’s agreed to be Skylar’s fake boyfriend/love coach at an upcoming family wilderness competition where her crush will be in attendance. What could go wrong?

1758367,2025-05-26T22:17:05.215614+00:00,"A Five-Star Sports Romance That Scores Big on Heart, Heat, and HumorTessa Bailey’s Pitcher Perfect is a grand slam of a romance novel—equal parts steamy, funny, and heartfelt. With her signature blend of laugh-out-loud banter and emotional depth, Bailey crafts a story that will charm fans of enemies-to-lovers, fake dating, and found family tropes from page one to the last pitch.At the heart of the story is Robbie Corrigan, a rookie NHL player whose life seems pretty perfect: he’s just made it to the pros, has a reputation as a charming “orgasm donor,” and enjoys the attention that comes with it. That is, until he meets Skylar Paige—a no-nonsense softball pitcher who sees right through his player persona. Skylar is laser-focused, highly organized (with actual itineraries for her personal goals!), and completely uninterested in being another name on Robbie’s long list of flings.The tension between Skylar and Robbie is electric from the start. Their initial interactions are full of witty, fast-paced dialogue and that delicious friction that only great enemies-to-lovers stories can deliver. But Bailey doesn’t stop at the surface-level tension. As the two are thrown together in a fake relationship—complete with a wilderness competition and Skylar’s not-so-secret crush on someone else—they begin to peel back each other’s emotional layers. What starts as a favor turns into something deeper, something real, and watching them slowly come to terms with their feelings is immensely satisfying.One of the standout aspects of this novel is the emotional growth both characters undergo. Robbie is more than just a flirtatious hockey star; beneath his charm is someone deeply loyal, protective, and yearning for something real. Skylar, too, has to navigate what she really wants in a relationship, and her journey is equally compelling. Bailey handles their individual arcs with tenderness, humor, and just the right amount of angst.And then there’s the spice—Pitcher Perfect delivers. The intimacy between Skylar and Robbie is not just physically charged but emotionally resonant. Every steamy moment is layered with meaning, vulnerability, and care, making their connection feel incredibly genuine.The supporting cast only adds to the story’s appeal. From the chaos of the family wilderness competition to the cameos by characters from the previous books in the series, there’s a sense of community and warmth that deepens the reading experience. Robbie’s friendships, Skylar’s family, and even the unexpected appearances from familiar faces all make the world feel rich and lived in.In the end, Pitcher Perfect is a romance that delivers on every front: it’s funny, flirty, deeply emotional, and thoroughly enjoyable. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Tessa Bailey or new to her work, this book will remind you why she’s a standout in the contemporary romance genre.If you’re looking for a sports romance that brings the heat while also tugging at your heartstrings, Pitcher Perfect is a must-read.I received this book for free from Avon Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.",Pitcher Perfect,2025-02-11T13:33:18.109278,"Boston Bearcats rookie Robbie Corrigan is living the dream.

In this story the ground work is laid early on with the introduction of the various parties and groups to a private and secluded tropical island by Eton, a “Mr. Beast”-esque online influencer who has become a billionaire and has monetary prizes in store for his guests.The central protagonist is Ruth who was the a survivor of a cult called Petition which she begins to realise committed the Jones style massacre on this island 20 years earlier. Ruth was a child how had survived a awful experience so its believable she hadn't recognised where she was until she arrived.That's another aspect of Coates writing of horror, she always includes suspense and twists but she never relies on an unbelievable coincidence to progress her plot. Its in the last third of the novel where the horror and butchery begins to unfold with well developed reveals to explain all that had happened up until then.A satisfying and well crafted conclusion though when I thought the smart and competent character deserved to make it - that one hurt.",How Bad Things Can Get,2025-05-24T15:23:57.158836,"The Blair Witch Project meets Fyre Fest in this bloody new thriller from the queen of scares, Darcy Coates!

It took me some times to be fully hooked but as a big fan of From Below by Darcy Coates, I knew I have to push a bit more when I started to struggle a bit around 33%. A bit slow at first, especially because the story doesn't need a lot of setting per se to work and it could had kicked earlier than that. It's gore, fun to read and well put together. I like the backstory and how everything is linked together. Darcy Coates is excellent when it comes to atmosphere, ambience and perfectly knitted plots and frame. I didn't really root for the character but the plot is so good that I still really loved it.     If you seek a bit of gory horror in the superficial social media world and some cultist stuff seasonned with wild games, you're in for a threat.

Her landlord, Nathaniel, is a former alchemist running his parents' apothecary after their untimely deaths. (He is hiding his own past regrets and is, of course, brooding and handsome. He's also a #hotnerd, which is one of my favorite tropes.) They fight their reluctant attraction, which gives an enjoyable amount of push-pull between Nathaniel and Violet. There's also a nice amount of tension as Violet fights against everything she's been taught so she can do good in the world, especially as you watch to see how it will be challenged and how she'll handle that challenge. I did enjoy this romantasy, and while the overall tone is serious every now and then there's a kernel of humor that helped to lighten things up. The supporting characters were distinct and well-written, adding a nice amount of depth to the story (Bartleby and Peri were my favorites). My main issue is with the pacing: this story is slower-paced but it's also a bit uneven. It dragged in parts then surged in others and it was hard for me to consistently enjoy the story as it didn't always hold my attention (which is a shame, because there's a lot going on in this story that was interesting). This book is perfect for fans of opposites-attract open-door romance, who like fantasy mixed in with their love story. This is a new-to-me author and there was enough to like in this book that I'd definitely read her again. (I feel like this could be the start of a series, and I genuinely want to know Bartleby's backstory!) One last note: pay attention to content warnings. Despite the colorful and cheerful cover, there is some darker content so tread a little lightly. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars. Publishes November 18, 2025. This review is based on a complimentary eARC of the book, all opinions are my own.",Violet Thistlewaite Is Not a Villain Anymore,2025-03-07T02:59:52.662708,"Guy Shadowfade is dead, and after a lifetime as the dark sorcerer’s right-hand, Violet Thistlewaite is determined to start over—not as the fearsome Thornwitch, but as someone kind. Someone better. Someone good.

The quaint town of Dragon’s Rest, Violet decides, will be her second chance—she’ll set down roots, open a flower shop, keep her sentient (mildly homicidal) houseplant in check, and prune dark magic from the twisted boughs of her life.

Violet’s vibrant bouquets and cheerful enchantments soon charm the welcoming townsfolk, though nothing seems to impress the prickly yet dashingly handsome Nathaniel Marsh, an alchemist sharing her greenhouse. With a struggling business and his own second chance seemingly out of reach, Nathaniel has no time for flowers or frippery—and certainly none for the intriguing witch next door.

When a mysterious blight threatens every living plant in Dragon’s Rest, Violet and Nathaniel must work together through their fears, pasts, and growing feelings for one another to save their community. But with a figure from her past knocking at her door and her secrets threatening to uproot everything she’s worked so hard to grow, Violet can’t help but wonder…does a former villain truly deserve a happily-ever-after?",Emily Krempholtz
